Taj_NEU_1,11-Aug-19,Jul-19,14,August,July,"Taj Mahal mausoleum is beautiful but its full of scam . We paid 1300 INR each and they gave us an official guide . I asked if we need to pay for it , they said its part of the fee . Believing in that , we accept the tour guide . But actually its annoying to have him with us when we just want to enjoy the view . At the end of the tour , he wanted to take us to the govt shops but we refused because we wanted to take our breakfast back to the hotel . He asked if we have nz currency with us we said no . We are about to give him 200 INR he said the minimum tip is 10USD or 700 INR . We said we do not have enough cash . He offered to take us to nearby atm which really annoyed us and we reminded him that its part of the tour guiding us . He ended up leaving us and did not get anything . I suggest if you want to see Taj Mahal just go for a day trip and go to Rajasthan . Everyone is expecting a tip in Agra and kinda stressful dealing with them for 3 days we were there . Agra itself is a slum and damp .",,,,2,none,none,NZFemaletraveler80

Taj_NEU_3,20-May-19,May-19,7,May,May,"This iconic monument is an inspiration to all with the incredible attention to detail in the exquisite carving & inscriptions throughout the building . Unbelievable to think it took 20,000 labourers almost 22 years to build between 1631-1653 . The Taj Mahal soars to a height of 74.2 metres yet it still looks very delicate . The four facades of the tomb are flanked by arches followed by smaller arches . At the corners are 4 three-storeyed minarets . The garden surrounding the Taj is beautiful in its own right . A truly remarkable piece of architecture .",,,,96,"New Plymouth, New Zealand",New Zealand,Wendy w

Its the tourists and the staff behaviour at the entrance that suck the joy out of the experience . The place is terribly crowded on most days especially on a sunday . Everything is overpriced in the vicinity as is the norm with tourist places . The signage is very confusing .

Taj_NEU_6,8-May-19,Apr-19,10,May,April,"Hi ! I have visited the Taj few times earlier as well . But this time was with a special purpose - The Full Moon Visit . And we all were really excited for that . I went to see the sunrise as well as the sunset on the same day , and it was worth it . Every penny of it . But the full moon visit was extremely disappointing because there is no visibility of Taj . And there is no view . Perhaps , there could be if someone applies their brain . If they allow people to look at the Taj from the side opposite where the moon is , we could get a beautiful view of both Taj Mahal beneath the Moon , possibly .",,,,6,"New Delhi, India",India,manikd47
Taj_NEU_7,6-May-19,Apr-19,7,May,April,"A piece of poetry in architecture 4 sure but I would not be being truthful though if I failed to mention-as many have , the smell from the EXTREME water pollution ( Yamuna River ) that one finds oneself inhaling or more correctly nearly passing out to , as one exits the electric buggy or strolls along the Taj's back terrace ! And of course the very rude staff and endless harassment - inside and out and sick and starving animals on the road in . We went at sunsrise and the vision you see as the TM appears stepping through the gate can onlly be described as a breath taking mirage . But the demotion 5 to 3 stars is because everything else - has to be improved . I went below to see the real tombs of the couple and prayers being said - which was moving but was rudely hearded down for this . The pollution of the Yamuna river , due to drains etc is a major issue - I saw it mentioned quite alot in the major national papers whilst i was in India . Toilets were not open until museum parts open at 9am .",,,,122,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",United Kingdom,pickytweeter
Taj_NEU_8,9-Apr-19,Apr-19,17,April,April,"We signed up for World Taj Adventure Tours out of Delhi . I was not paying particular attention to the fact that Monument Entrance Fee was not included . Make sure you remember to bring extra rupees - 1200 per person for the entrance fee . Then if you get a professional photographer photos ( which the tour guide pushed have another 3000 to 5000 rupees to pay for the pictures plus the digital CD . We agreed to the photos , because - how many times will we see the Taj Mahal in our life ? Faisal ( our tour guide ) did a good job of explaining the story . After touring and seeing the tombs , we went to a marble inlay work store . The owner explained how long it took to make one tiny intricate flower . And he showed us how the light hits the marble of the Taj in different circumstances ( moon light , sunrise , sunset , monsoon & daytime ) They really are beautiful - but again another marketing push . We were okay saying no to spending more money , but do not love it when the tour guides continuously put you into those situations . We said we were not interested in seeing the black India stone . We drove 3 hours from our hotel in Delhi with Ali . He brought along chips , candy & water for the long ride . He also pointed out places of interest along the way . Overall , it was a very quiet drive with hardly any traffic for most of the trip on the new highway . We fell asleep in the back of the car for a good hour .

Taj_NEU_18,3-Jan-19,Dec-18,15,January,December,"This exclusive visit is only offered during the full-moon and a night or two either side , so as our visit coincided , we felt obligated to see the Taj Mahal at night . Oh dearBooking the visit is easier said than done as you have to buy the tickets directly from their booking office , the day before , with your passports , and wearing only prime colours ( ok - I added that bit ) . Our guide had all the requisite material so we were delighted to hear he would managed to book us on , although he would not be accompanying us ( for reasons that became apparent during our visit ) . We simply had to turn up , 30 minutes before , sit in a small waiting room with 20 or so others whilst our passports and tickets were inspected under microscope . We were then divested of phones , all electrical equipment and our wristwatches ( really - I did not add that bit leaving only a camera ( a phone camera is not allowed , even if its not connected ) . We were then put through security screening and directed towards a bus . At no time were we told what was going on , and the security guards surrounding us were carrying rifles . I do not recall hearing of anyone attempting to steal the Taj Mahal , and this is obviously why . We were ushered onto buses , again in silence , driven through another security check and finally escorted to the gate of the Taj Mahal , which was in thick fog and floodlit so nothing was visible and we were not entirely sure in which direction we were supposed to be facing . Suddenly , the floodlights went out and in a moment of drama , we looked round to see . nothing . The fog was so thick , and the palace so far away , that all we saw was a vague ( I mean vague ) outline which could have been anything , but having been told it was the Taj Mahal , we all nodded at the majestic blob in the fog . After spending twenty or so minutes pretending to be overwhelmed but in reality wondering if this was a case of the Emperors new suit , we returned to the bus in silence , comparing photos with the rest of the group to see who had the most impressive shot of , well , nothing . An American chap managed to get a shot of what looked like a snowman , but we later learned he would actually forgotten to remove his lens cap . We mentioned to our guide what an unpleasant and unfruitful visit wed had , and he seemed surprised we had expectations of anything else .",,,,55,"Elstree, United Kingdom",United Kingdom,GrumpyBugger

Taj_NEU_53,23-Jul-18,May-18,20,July,May,"I have visited Taj for 5 times now , every visit shows me this will lose attraction soon . The marble is losing its colour due to population , people touching and breaking stuffs adds more misery to it . So hurry up and see it before it loses its charm . The place should be avoided in the summer as the whole premises heats up due to the stone , and there are not many shade to rest . Also there are lot of people due to the summer holidays in India . Buying ticket online only helps you to jump the ticket queue which is not a big enough problem . The security check takes a lot of time and you will end up standing in a queue in the hot sun for an hour and half . Renovation is under process and it is expected to continue till Oct 2019 . When I visited the front minarets and the entrance gates were being worked on . Even the garden was being redone . The fountains are kept off and there is no water in the fountain tanks . Buy shoe covers from outside vendors and please dispose them in dustbins after use , do not through them along the way or in the garden . If you do not want to buy them there is a place where you can leave your shoe before entering the main mahal . You do not have to take the battery vehicles you can walk it down . Also do not fall for the one who says they will explain things on the way and charge you 60 to 100 Rs . Its barely a minute ride , you can share it at 10 Rs per person . They also convince you to go to the local shops so that they get commission from the shopkeepers . Do this after visiting the Mahal . Backpacks and other hang luggage ( except ladies handbags and camera bags ) has to be kept in the cloak room outside . So do not carry valuables within them .",,,,4,Mumbai,India,Sunand S

It is beautiful and impressive , but at the same time it did not have any use - so was not as interesting to me as the fort where you are told about the lives of the people who used it , this is essentially an enormous if pretty headstone ( and I could not help thinking a huge waste of money by the powers of the time ) !

I have never seen any world heritage structures like this before . I love my evey hour inside taj mahal EXCEPT the fact that it ( and the whole city of Agra is ) riddled with touts and scammers . Several tout / scam experiences to avoid - 1 . You can not enter taj with several items like tripod , cigarettes , lighter , laptop and BOOKS ( quite strange to hear ) . If you carry them , you have to put it in a free locker room outside which was fine for me BUT when I wanted to take my item back , the guy shamelessly asked for tips . I did not give , of course , because it is just one book and it is clearly written as free facility for foreign tourists that have paid so much . 2 . Toilets in taj mahal are supposedly free for foreigners . There is writing in front of the toilet but when you enter the toilet , the guy in front will ask for money from you . Tell him that the writing in front of him says it is free for foreigners . DO NOT PAY even a single rupee . 3 . Inside taj mahal , NEVER ASK security guard / ASI staffs / any other officials seem to direct you . They will ask for tips after taking your pictures . One guy offered me to take pictures of taj , he took 2 pictures of me and my friend then shamelessly asked for 200 rupees . 4 . Be careful when buying things from the shops around taj mahal . See tripadvisor recommendation on shopping before you buy stuffs . One place to shop that I recommend is THE WAREHOUSE GIFT . No need to bargain and the price is fair .

Taj_NEU_93,18-Feb-18,Feb-18,29,February,February,"Obviously you are going to visit the Taj if you are in Agra so I thought it would be more helpful to leave some tips for visitors rather than some kind of review . As most people say arrive early ! Gates open at 6am . We got there for 7:30am and the queue was already starting to build . There are loads of hotels in the area that are a really short walk away from the gates , so getting there early is totally doable . The price is 1000 rupees for foreigners which you buy from the ticket stand , watch out for the different queues for foreigners and locals and also watch out for queue jumpers ! You do not pay any extra for cameras . Once you get your ticket you collect your water bottle and shoe covers from another window and then join the queue to enter . This queue is split into men and women and also foreigners and locals so keep a look out for the signs . Once in the gate you stay in the queue for security were they will scan your bags . They took my cigarettes and lighter so do not bother bringing them as you cannot collect them back at the end . There are guides around the entrance offering tours , they were quoting around 200 rupees to us . I do not think one is necessarily but I am sure they have lots of interesting info to pass on . The whole place is like a massive photo shoot so you are constantly dodging and be pushed out of the way by overly enthusiastic tourists wanting to get shots from the best angles . This is why it is better to arrive as early as possible ! There was a lot of pushing , shoving and jumping in at the Diana Bench so be prepared ! You need to put the shoe covers on once you reach the mausoleum . once inside you are herded around by officers and shouted at not to take photos ( although everyone does ) inside is small , so you just walk around the cenotaphs and then out . We were all kicked out early because the Canadian Prime Minister was visiting so it was closed to the public after 9am . It is probably best to check ( if this is at all possible ) that nothing is going on and that it is open to the public on the day you plan to visit . You would be incredibly annoyed if you made the trip from Delhi or were only in Agra for one day and end up not being able to visit ! I would allow for two hours minimum to see the whole thing . It is very touristy and a bit stressful with all the crowds , but that is to be expected from such a place . Just a note on the pricing . I understand the differentiation between local and foreigner price is to make sure Indians are not priced out of their own tourist attractions but 30 rupees to 1000 rupees ! This only perpetuates the myth that foreigners have loads of money and encourages locals to try and over charge foreign visitors for everything ! I would not half mind if the profits were reinvested into the local area because Agra and its inhabitants would seriously benefit from them doing so . If you like Islamic architecture like this I would recommend the Grand Mosque in Abu Dhabi .

The real structure is far more beautiful than wat we see in the photos or movies . This monument is not run like its one of the seven wonders . Extremely disappointed . Long weekends do not even bother visiting , extremely long queues , no security to control the crowd except for checking . by the time you get inside its already time for you to leave . They have separate queues for women nd children and men . So when you are travelling with children , nd make entrance through diff queues , the women are already done going around and ready to leave by the time you enter the monument after security check . Washrooms will be difficult to find because they have very poor signage Nd no one really knows where it is . Very limited personnel inside the monument so no one will be there to help . The entire place looks like its been run by agents . For entry you have agents who just get into the queues . The queue runs thru a very narrow street . Nobody bothers to question them .

Taj_NEU_111,14-Dec-17,Nov-17,32,December,November,"There are just some places you have to see if you are in the vicinity and the Taj Mahal is one of them , regardless of what you read , or do not , you just have to see it for your own eyes . And so we did . Box checked ! The Taj Mahal is very beautiful , but like many beautiful things , its best appreciated from a distance . Sitting on a rooftop terrace watching the sun set on the Taj was marvellous . We could have left it at that , and the view from our hotel room . But we wanted to be there for the sunrise , to get the Taj Mahal in that wonderful first light . Not to be ! First , there was the bus ride from the road down to the ticket counter near the east gate . Then , figuring out where to pay the extortionate foreign entry fee and then finding out that you also need to pick up the shoe covers , no one is there to explain this to you and there are no signs providing guidance , thank goodness there were kind folks in the line who were willing to help . And then we stood there , the sun was rising , that beautiful first light was turning to haze and still the line was not moving . Well over a hundred people got up very early for that sunrise experience and paid heavily for it , but it seems the security folks had a different agenda , finally , after about an hour , we started to move , to file slowly through the quasi-security check , set up ( I think ) more to tick off tourists than to actually provide security , after all that wait I found out that a small flexible tripod I had was a risk to national security and had to be put in a locker . So out of the line and secure area I had to go , store the tripod in the provided locker room and then get back in line , seriously ? Finally , we got in and now the light is nothing spectacular , that had been lost while the guards had their morning chai , or something equally mind-numbing . So , we stood around waiting our turn for the really nice perspective and sight-line shots while guides posed their clients in all the cliche poses , over and over again , As we got closer , we began to realize that there was a lot of dirt around the actual building and loitering locals who must have been let in to hit on tourist for pocket money for helping with their picture taking or trying to tell someone the monuments history . Also , I can understand the need to maintain a building like this and some scaffolding might be required but one side covered with scaffolding and no body using it was a real disappointment . But the dirt and the garbage lying around really made us wonder why the administrators of this site were ignoring the detractors to this potentially beautiful site . Where was all the money going that the foreign visitors had to fork over . Extremely poor maintenance is prevalent all over Rajasthan , where does the money get spent ? But here at the Taj Mahal , we are talking some big numbers and so much garbage and poorly maintained and dilapidated infrastructure , maybe one or two of the numerous guards standing around trying to look important could actually do something useful and pick up some garbage or swing a paintbrush . We left the Taj after an hour or so inside , fed up for feeling like we had been scammed and completely underwhelmed . And then the hawkers descended . Does every site in this country have to bombard tourists with people selling items of questionable quality at extortionate prices ? Are the kickbacks that important ? Could maybe just this one site be an exception because of its reverence on the world stage , I guess not . You can look past the garbage and the dirt and the money-grabbers and the inefficient administration and see a very marvellous building and walk away feeling content and happy . A lot of visitors do , and write glowing reports on sites like Trip Advisor . But nothing will ever change , the dirt and the garbage and all that is wrong will continue to greet frustrated and over-charged tourists . The Taj Mahal is a must do visit because you simply just have to . But when you have left and have had time to reflect on the entire experience , be honest in your evaluation . Mention the dirt and the garbage and the ridiculous fees and entry fiasco and just maybe , some administrator with a conscious will pay attention and something will get fixed . I will look forward to reading your reviews .",,,,94,"London, Canada",Canada,Sunnytoes54

Taj_NEU_113,3-Dec-17,Dec-17,17,December,December,"Went with high hopes of seeing one of the seven wonders of the world at sunrise . Started queuing at the ticket counter at 6am , but they only open the counter at 7am which by then was daylight . Joined the queue to enter - no signage to say male and female have different queues - which took another 2 hours . No idea how a security check can take so long . I do not know what time they actually opened the doors because the queue did not move at all for an hour . Then security refused entry of my little toy , and made me deposit it back at the cloak room . Other visitors were also arguing with the security over items like a laptop case , iPad keyboard etc . Harmless items rejected entry without rhyme or reason . My advise would be to go empty handed , and forget about waking up for sunrise . you would be lucky if you got in before 8.30 am . Sleep in and skip the queues . Foreigners , do collect your complimentary shoe covers at the cloak room next to the ticket counters . The tourist org needs to redesign the experience and put up clearer signs , minus the guides .

Taj_NEU_115,25-Nov-17,Nov-17,9,November,November,"let us face it - if you are in Agra as a tourist you are 99 % likely to visit the Taj Mahal and a negative review is not going to sway you . But I wanted to warn fellow travellers of a few things to make the experience a little better . First off , be warned that the locker facilities ( at least for the west gate ) are about 200 meters away from the security checkpoint . That means if security finds something on you that is not allowed then you will have to walk all the way back to the lockers and then all the way back to security and get in line all over again . I had to do this THREE TIMES because they told me I could not bring my laptop with me the first time and then the second time they told me I could not bring my small bendy tripod , microphone for my video camera , some plastic bags , a small notebook , and a small keychain toy . Luckily I had all day and was not in a rush but it was so frustrating that I was not told ahead of time . I am sure if I had scanned through TripAdvisor first , someone would have mentioned it - my bad ! That being said , the locker staff were friendly enough , I am sure this happens to them multiple times a day . So like my review title states - The Taj Mahal is an amazing attraction and a definite must-see when in Agra / India but the whole security process was a huge pain for me !",,,,23,"Vancouver, Canada",Canada,Chris54354

It is an average monument with loads of people visiting them everyday , but what they have forgotten is that they got to build on their service also . They treat the high paying foreign nationals with respect and their own people with not . I think the internal view of the monument is pretty average and nothing very special about it , there are hundreds of other monuments which also bear some of the same works . Just the difference would be the marble makes Taj Mahal more shiny and attractive . I am sure a place which embarks a dark truth in our history and built over the lives of many should not be really given so much of importance , especially not over the king .

The entrance fee includes a free ride from the ticket desk to the mausoleum entrance but you will not be told an you are likely to fall in another trap of either rickshaw , horse ride or bicycle . The view is beautiful even in this century from the outside though its being renovated currently . The inside is ok quite dark and a fast round not much to appreciate apart from the two tombs .

However I have been in India for 2 months & I am used to paying more as a foreigner but when it is 50r for India nationals & 1000r for foreigners , this is just tooo much . The building has lovely symmetry & it very pretty , but how it qualified for a wonder of the world I do not know . it is not that old , yes there is some intricate work , but let us face it , it is not an Egyptian pyramid , you can see how it was made . Most people go in the morning because it is cooler , but sunrise in Agra is just grey due to the smog . If you are on a 2 week itinerary then the price is not going to put you off but if you are traveling for a while then it probably would . My advice is go to the Mehtab Bagh park on the other side of the river for sunset , it has a much better view of the TM & is 200 to get in . Take a picnic & enjoy , the light is much better for photos as well in the afternoon , with a bit of a filter the sky will look blue . Another alternative is to spend the entrance fees on food & beer at Sanyia Palace Inn , it has good food & amazing views of the Taj at sunset , when the locals get on the roofs & fly their kite . TM is not worth 1000r . If you want to get around Agra it is a bit spread out my advice is to Tal a tuk tuk for the day , they are around 700-800 . Most of them are surly & unfriendly , I met the sweetest guy Rafik , who had been going it for 40yrs he now cannot see so someone drives his tuk tuk for him & he speaks to the clients in perfect English .

Taj_NEU_173,3-May-17,Jan-17,32,May,January,"Surprisingly , this was my least favorite of all the places I traveled and visited during my visit to this part of India ( Delhi region , Amritsar and Agra ) . Up to this point , I did not feel that anywhere I went was overly touristy . This was - and in the worst possible way . First of all , the tour guides , beggars and merchants are EXTREMELY aggressive . You should arrive with a game plan , because this is not the place to decide . They will see your hesitancy and become even more assertive . They are adept are pulling you into a seemingly harmless conversation and then trying to sell you their product or service . Make arrangements in advance if you want a tour guide . In my instance I had a private driver who could arrange anything I wanted ( of course he gets a commission for doing this ) . A word about drivers - they made my experience much easier . Get a good reference for one and take full advantage . I had one for 2 days / 1 night . It cost the equivalent of $ 120 US plus tip and worth it ! he will steer you clear of bad places and experiences and ensure that you are safely picked up when you are ready to leave an attraction / shopping / restaurant . Totally worth it . So back to the Taj . I chose to do this by myself rather than use a guide since all I really wanted was to enjoy the view . I was already well-versed on its history and architecture . Being a single , American BLONDE female attracted a lot of attention which I was used to since 95 % of the time anywhere I went I was the only Westerner ( and blonde to boot ) . The walk from the Visitor Center to the Taj entrance was like walking through a shark tank . it is the only time I got flustered and over-whelmed during my trip . Once on the Taj grounds , it is spectacular , but over-ridden with tourists who are oblivious to anyone else . Crowding , pushing as everyone vies for the perfect selfie angle . I was actually sad . Something that should have been so special and sacred was tainted by all this ignorant , obnoxious tourism . Walking through the palace itself was no better . People pushing and shoving . Funny thing is that the little old Indian ladies who are about 4 tall really resented me as the tall American and were especially rude . That was the only time I was treated thusly . ( And mind you , I was careful to dress modestly and respectfully throughout my trip always in loose flowing palazzo pants , India-inspired tops and wearing a scarf ) .

Taj_NEU_176,23-Apr-17,Apr-17,17,April,April,"It feels wrong giving such an iconic site as this just three stars and it is truly beautiful and a must see . There is not much to explore within the building itself but there are some grounds to wander around , the red fortifications that surround it are attractive and there is even a small museum ( which practically no-one visited whilst we were there ) . So why only three stars ? Well , Firstly there is the two-tier pricing structure that you get everywhere in India . If you are Indian you pay one price , if you are a foreign tourist you pay ( in the case of the Taj Mahal ) more than twenty times more ! I understand that this is more affordable for us than the locals but it still does not sit well with me . If entry can be a twentieth of the price then why pay so much more ? Secondly the streets around the Taj are not very pleasant . In the context of India they are perfectly normal but when you are visiting a world famous tourist attraction you expect more of an effort to be made . Outside , and even inside , the site you are constantly hassled by people wanting to act as a tour guide , wanting you to look in their shop and asking if you want to ride in their tuc-tuc . This is not something you can merely say no to and expect the matter to be ended as you will probably be asked a couple more times and then be expected to discuss why you do not want the offered service . Very irritating . Finally during my visit to this site the security officials thought that a good solution to the problem of so many visitors wanting to see the inside of the Taj was to suddenly stop people from leaving ( there is only one narrow way in and out ) and usher hundreds ( genuinely hundreds ) more people into the place until everyone was crammed in . Only then did they let people leave . All the while they , the security guards , were blowing their whistles furiously to gee people along .

We all purchased something But once a member of our group bought one item , he would be instantly mobbed . We did hire a tour guide ( a mistake in my book as the entire time , he is pushing you to visit the overpriced souvenir shop where he gets a cut of the sale ) . Also , we did not learn anything new from having a guide . Be sure to be on guard against the pickpockets too . Yes , it was crowded , but that was to be expected .

Taj_NEU_203,30-Jan-17,Dec-16,32,January,December,"there is nothing I can add about the grandeur of the Taj Mahal itself . it is a true wonder . But I want to write about our experience eschewing private cars and couch tours , and instead taking the Gatimaan Express return train trip from Delhi to Agra for the day . Firstly , the train routinely takes longer than advertised . it is is meant to be a breakthrough train for India , travelling at 160 kph , covering the distance in 100 minutes . A car will take about 3 3.5 hours . But actually in both directions it was closer to 135 minutes . The Exec Chair food and service was generous , but we did not appreciate the multiple requests for tips from the staff . It was not clear what the official tip request was , and what the opportunistic requests were . Nizamuddin train station in Delhi is also a dump . Agra Cantt at least had a semi-rural charm ( cows and monkeys wandering between the stacks of luggage ) . Secondly , even the pre-paid taxi booths at Agra Cantt station are run by the touts ! Having read warnings about the large number of touts greeting the Gatimaan at Agra I thought I was prepared . We got off the train , we brushed off the cacophony of taxi sir ! and guide sir ! requests , and headed straight for the pre-paid taxi booth . In fact , for the last few meters we were led to that booth by the touts , and that was the first warning . The second was that the so called policeman in the booth would not make eye contact , and was wearing what was the same color as a police uniform , but bore little other resemblence . Basically he was a front for the touts . What was meant to be pre-paid soon turned into a post-paid . Here I should have listened to my gut and gone to the official tourist office . Instead I went along with it and we hoped in the taxi with a deal for 1000 rupees for a day of driving around Agra . Then another person hops in , the same tout that guided us to the pre-paid taxi booth , and announces that he is our guide for the day , for a mere 500 rupees extra . We tried to argue that we did not need him , but he said he was necessary because the driver did not speak english , it was him or nothing , and that we had already agreed to the 1000 rupees at least . I asked for his credentials and he showed some dodgy semi-official looking papers . Against my better judgement we took him along , intending to ignore him . Suffice it to say , it was an awkward day and by the end I think he was as sick of us as we were of him . They happily delivered us to Agra for the return trip quite early . Oh , and while the Taj took credit cards ( thankfully with demonetization the Agra fort did not , which led to another expensive trip to a dodgy money exchange joint . All up we got fleeced bad , and I thought I was prepared against it Take a trusted hotel driver from Delhi . Including transport in Delhi to Nizamuddin it will be faster . Or if you really want to take the train , prebook a guide with the official tourist office to meet you on the platform by name .",,,,280,Zurich,Switzerland,DouglasA587

Taj_NEU_222,8-Jan-17,Aug-16,25,January,August,"From Garguon , it took us about 2-3 hours away to travel to the Taj Mahal , which is located in Agra , New Delhi . It was an interesting bus ride as we navigated amidst the hustle and bustle of weekend Indian life on the busy and somewhat chaotic streets with the occasional cow or two . By the time we arrived at the Taj Mahal gates , it was already about 1 in the afternoon . The bus was parked some distance away from the entrance so as the preserve the pathway that leads up to the Taj Mahal . The moment we got off the bus , we were bombarded by touts eager to sell their wares to tourists . If you are not interested , just ignore them and walk away . Once you start giving them any attention , a whole bunch of them will descend upon you in a somewhat aggressive manner . We were alighted some distance away from the entrance . The pathway was undergoing construction at the time so there was plenty of dust in the air . There were also horse carts at the sides available for hire . The horses seemed overworked and tired ( poor horses ) . The queue to enter the Taj Mahal that day was long but apparently not as ridiculous long as some photos you can find on Google and it was fast moving enough . You pay more if you are not a local , much more . For foreigners , admission fees are 1000 rupees , while locals only pay 40 rupees . There are separate queues for both locals and tourists , and both males and females have their own lines . So in total there were 4 queues ongoing at the same time with crowds of people waiting to enter the Taj Mahal . Once the queue has reached the entrance , you are then checked by security . They literally take out everything in your bag to check and open every pouch or wallet , item by item , which totally defeats the purpose of having to place the bag through the scanner in the first place . Our guide was an interesting one as he shared with us some stories of the Taj Mahal and the history behind it . The Taj Mahal was built out of a kings love for his favorite wife ( who died when she was giving birth to their 14th child ) . It consists of a mosque and a guest house which is an exact replica of the mosque , with gardens between them . The Taj Mahal also contains a mausoleum , where the king and his favorite wife are buried . The mausoleum is made out of white marble inlaid with semi-precious stones such as jade , crystal , lapis lazuli , amethyst and turquoise .

He was very knowledgeable and looked after us well I think . The Taj is amazing , but the crowds were not . As foreigners , we were asked to be in countless photos with locals .

Entry to the Taj for a non native is expensive with 1000 rupees ( approx . 12 or 15 ) per person . With the ticket comes a free 0.5 l bottle of water and shoe covers . You have to go through a lengthy and slightly chaotic security procedure and are only allowed phone , camera , water and money .

On the grounds there is barely a place to sit in the shade to protect you when the sun is boiling you . The Taj itself is beautiful from afar and the outside with elaborate marble work and decorations . The inside is disappointing . it is dark and stuffy and you get shoved around , pushed and security guards are happy to blow their whistles in your ear if you are not moving fast enough .

Signage around the grounds are rare and facilities , although they claim to be free still ask for tips or when you want some toilet paper . do not expect a decently clean washroom either .

Since the Tajmahal is white in color , it appreaps to be differnt colors depending on the ambient light . Mornng and evening in orange or gold color and in the sunny day - Milky white . People will step on a stage like structure where there is a Marble bench used by shahjahan to watch Tajmahal . You will find many tourists waiting to sit and take a photograph . You may engage a professional photograhers will take nice photos for a fee and make a Album and give you . my self engaged a professional photographer and got 12 pics for 600 INR .

The tombs that are seen by public are not real ones . by the actaul tombs are in the undergorudn chamber eexactly underneath these false tombs and publick are not prohibited to go underground chambers . Iam not sure why . What needs to be observed here is the intricat details and delicate sculpting design of the grille and other marble designees used to decorate Tajmahal . Many precious stones like lapiz lazuli , opal , emerald , ruby were embedded to these grille to make more beautiful . Once ou are finished with viewing , You may take photos out side as many as you want and rest there .

Please avoid drinking water from the drinking water provided by the management . I cought diorrhea and the toilets are in the Taj mahal compound are not upto the mark but cost 5 INR . 2 . Please do not buy the cheap items sold by the moving venders who comes and sells you a Tajmahal penstand . rather go and buy some where else in the city . 3 . If you go by car to Taj mahal , You will need to park the vehicle in the parking stand and pay 100 INR as fee and from there battery operated vehicles will take you to entrance ticket counter cost is 10 INR . do not pay more than that . if you wish , You may walk down its is very near .

But I just Hope the management of this wonderful monument really improves one day to preserve It forever . The price I paid as tourist ( 1000 INR ) is 20 times more than the price Indian people pay , although there is a big difference I understand that western people can pay more , I just Hope the money helps to save Taj Mahal . Although It seemed to me estrange that when I paid for my tickets one of the 500 INR note was kept by the guy in the counter in his shirt pocket and the other notes went to the box . I almost can not get in as entrance was So crowded , even buying tickets at 15:30 h. I managed to run to the doors when they were closing them at 17 h and the security guard let me in but let many indian people out that had pay their tickets Too . The moment was So stressful for visitors and security staff as many people was complaining and shouting . Inside the amount of people I found at the same time was just ridiculous , I think entrance should be limited to a certain number of people per day booking tickets in advance , otherwise It Will not be properly preserved . You can take a shuttle from booking Office to the Gates but people Will run and fight to have a Seat . From the moment you get the tickets the information just dissapears , no signs , no staff , no arrows or directions , nothing ! They do not give you a map and It is not easy to find the other Gates . Instead , in your way to the Gates you will find many people trying to push you to go into their shop or their rickshaw , fake tourist guides , scummers , etc . Since the moment you buy a ticket the area should be delimited to staff and visitors , I do not understand how can you still get motorbikes and tuc - tucs running around the Taj Mahal walls , among people offering to Skip the queue for money , fake guides , etc . It could make your visit unpleasent . Technically the cloak room was included in the price but the guy there asked me directly for money at the end .

Starting from witnessing the sad lame horses that ferried oblivious visitors to its gates , to the heavy iron bar cattle channels you are ferried into to get through the doors . Once inside the Taj there is a mass of humanity . You can hardly take a photo as there are just so many people . There was no water in the famous streams in front of the Taj so no chance of the famous reflection . There was however a sleeping dog , ( I checked and he was alive ) and this actually was the best thing about our visit as it made us smile . Whoever is responsible for the day to day running of this wonderful place needs a serious policy review . The gardens and ornamental ( empty ) waterways are full of plastic bottles and other garbage . Getting closer to the Taj the throng of people gets more intense . The queues were horrendous . We spotted a sign which said fast track for expensive ticket which we did not have but we took anyway and we got to the front quickly . Inside the mausoleum there is nothing to see ! Even though people were queing for hours . You just go around it like a merrygoround of compacted people and all you see is the stone interior of the dome . It was actually a very sad visit for us for something we had dreamed about seeing all our lives . We were due to spend 2 days in Agra and visit the Taj several times but we cut our stay short . We did visit Agra Fort on our way out of town and this place is amazing and the view of the Taj is magical .

Be aware - the price jumped April 1st , 2016 to 1250 rupees ( up from 750 rupees ) . Tip 1 . Go at sunrise . After speaking to others who did this , I think it is the optimum time to visit . Less people and the sun rising and changing its color was magical . I tried at sunset but the magic did not happen as the sun did not set behind the temple but alongside it . 2 . Pay for a guide or download an app that will explain the Taj Mahal and its history . This will def give you a much better experience guaranteed . 3 . If the lines are too long to go inside , do not bother . there is not much to see and it is really cramped . The two tombs are replicas created by the man's daughter . The real tombs are located 20 below out of sight . 4 . If the fee is too high , go to the garden across the river from the Taj Mahal . It may be the backside but it is still a nice view . You could also visit the baby Taj Mahal . We had planned to but there was a communication breakdown w / our tuk tuk driver . Finally I would also recommend visiting the fort and again , hiring a guide or download an app . I had a phenomenal guide , he gave me his card which is around here somewhere .

Do not listen to your tour guide about purchasing from the vendors outside the taj . He will insist that he will take you to a factory where they make replica using genuine marble and gem stones . That is a blatant lie as we were caught with this . We spent almost twice the amount to purchase a miniature taj only to get home and find it broken despite the seller telling us it will never break because it is made of genuine marble . So if you want to buy souvenoirs , go ahead and buy from whomever you want to buy from . Also , clothes are very expensive in Agra . We stayed at four points by Sheraton .

Taj_NEU_353,3-Feb-16,Jan-16,30,February,January,"So , I would have liked to give 3.5 / 5 if I could . Giving it a 3 feels low . But I will try to justify it ! Basically , it is the Taj Mahal , and it is incredible . the story , the grounds , the construction , the monument itself are all absolutely incredible . But at the same time , I came away disappointed . First problem - it is NOT easy to get to . The closest major airport you can fly to to see the Taj is Delhi . But the Taj is in Agra , which by car is about 3.5-4.5 hours from Delhi . There are also trains , which can get there in about 2 hours , but those are the express trains , and they book up early and do not leave very often . Also it is not the easiest to get to the train stations , figure out where you are going , and then get to the Taj from the closest stop . The biggest problem though is the pollution . Delhi is one of the most polluted cities in the world . So first factor in your 4-8 hours of travel through thick cough-inducing air to get to the Taj . Then expect to have dull hazy pictures of the Taj Mahal istelf , NOT the pictures you will see with beautiful blue skies and perfect clear reflections in the reflecting pool . From the entrance gate , it is honestly like looking through thick fog , and you cannot even see the detail of the incredible stonework facade of the monument . Which will also limit your willingness to stick around in the area and enjoy your visit to the place you worked so hard to see . If you are older , or have breathing problems like Asthma , I would honestly say you might reconsider how badly you want to see the Taj Mahal , but at the very least , bring some medication ! Then there is the hawkers . At the spot you get dropped off to head towards the monuments there are dozens of people looking to convince you to take their rickshaw , or their camel , or their little electric bike to go half a K to the ticket stands . Others try to convince you to take them with you to take your picture . More still trying to be your guide . And then more looking to sell you handfuls of little items . I am used to fighting past hawkers especially in places like this , but these folks were particularly persistent and not friendly at all when you shoot them down . So in the end , would I do it again ? Yes . it is worth it . But I cannot give it a full 4 or 5 because what would otherwise be an incredible experience was more like an incredible thing to see , despite the challenging itself itself . If you do go , be sure to book a guide BEFORE you get to the Taj Mahal . He / she can help you navigate the area , push away the hawkers , and find you the best time of day / location to get a decent picture through the smog .",,,,14,"Orange County, California",United States of America,chrisjl17
Taj_NEU_354,2-Feb-16,Jan-16,6,February,January,"This is a an imposing and impressive monument . However I had 2 concerns at the time of my January ( Indian public holiday ) visit . The first issue was the vast queue of fellow-visitors that made access very slow and also proved stressful in maintaining physical contact with companions . The second and more crucial issue was the high atmospheric pollution level . The sky over Agra ( and for that matter over Delhi perhaps caused largely by short-term unfavorable weather conditions , was smoggy and stagnant , possibly posing a health risk for those susceptible to Asthma .

Our friend hired a bus for Rs70 to take us without having other passengers share . Coming out after closing cost us more than twice as much as most operators had gone home for the day . As westerners we were targeted by people trying to sell us stuff and offer us guides . We were warned to be very careful of pickpockets . One hawker offended our friend on our way out and made his mother angry . That effectively chased the hawkers away at least while we returned to our car . We were traveling when Security was high and it was a bit scary being separated into foreigners and residents , then male and female . I was alone in line but some American women said they would look after me . Bags are scanned and body pat down is part of the process . Reforming our group for a few photos and we were separated again . Foreigner queue is very quick , but our friends line moved slowly . We could leave our shoes on with shoe protecters that were provided on the more expensive ticketThe Taj Mahal is beautiful - of course . We had a lovely time photographing it and enjoying it is grace and beauty . When we entered the tomb we were quickly taken aside by an older man who used a torch to show us the beautiful stones in the marble . He told us he was not a guide and hurriedly showed us the features , then asked us to pay .

Up close it becomes obvious why the Taj is one of the wonders of the world , the carvings and architecture are amazing ! However , the condition of the monument is sad , and we were absolutely appalled at the air quality ! The density of the air restricted views . As seems standard in India , visitors disregarded all rules , such as do not touch , do not use flash photography , Stay out of the garden , etc . Unfortunately , all of these forbidden behaviors are contributing to the poor condition of an irreplaceable treasure . In addition , lines were absolutely crazy with everyone pushing to get ahead , attendants had little or no control . Unlike on our previous trip , one is no longer permitted downstairs to the mausoleum . Guests are pushed through the buildings at a rapid pace in half-way policed lines .

Taj_NEU_398,11-Sep-15,Aug-15,6,September,August,"My wife and I went on a day tour to go see the taj mahal in Agra , India . First getting to the actual grounds of the taj mahal is a hassle , good luck trying to get passed all the street merchants that follow you and try to sell you stuff and it is a bit overcrowded , but what else can you expect from a over populated country . Another thing is that foreigners have to pay more on the entrance fees than the citizens . Also beware of pickpockets while inside the tomb , so that pretty much sums up the bad part of the Taj mahal . Now for the good part , the grounds are well maintained inside , the architecture is wonderful , and overall it looks amazing . Worth the the visit but just keep in mind of a few things that could make your day trip a not so good experience .",,,,12,"Toronto, Canada",Canada,C8490JYdavidb
Taj_NEU_399,10-Sep-15,Aug-15,18,September,August,1 . We booked for Taj view at full moon night and we felt cheated . After so much security checks and facing rude arrogant staff you get to see Taj only from 200 metres away and it was pitch dark and no moon over the Taj . The ticket price is hefty at 500 odd bucks and simply not worth it . One rating less is due to point 1.2 . The staff is extremely rude and arrogant . They should not forget their families run because of Taj and the tourists . Apparently the night view requires everyone to carry photo id proofs including the small children as well . When we told staff at Shilpagram ( the reporting point ) that we do not have ids for all people and left it at hotel they said no problem and allowed us to proceed . But to our surprise there was a gentleman in safari suit near Taj scanning entrance who insisted that he will not allow anyone without I would proofs . Insisting was Ok but the rudeness was not called for after paying the huge sum for a useless view anyway . 3 . Next day morning we again went there . Taj looked much more splendid this time . We hired a photographer called Bunty Agarwal who did a good job and was very polite and courteous . Go early at 6:30 a.m. to avoid the rush and view Taj at your leisure . After this visit the feeling of having visited a 7 wonder sinked in and we left with happy memory . All 3 stars only for this .,,,,83,"Bengaluru, India",India,amitchhaperia
Taj_NEU_400,9-Sep-15,Sep-15,6,September,September,It has to be seen to be appreciated but strange thing is I went in the 80's and enjoyed it so I took my kids to see it last month and it did not have the same appeal . Now you queue in line packed together have your belongings taken apart and then at every bit your told to hurry up and move along . You do not really get to stop and enjoy . there is no curators or anything to tell you about anything . My advice do your own research and go very early morning before the crowds you may get to relax and enjoy the place . The structure itself loses none of its appeal no matter how many times you go .,,,,6,London,United Kingdom,sampochin

Taj_NEU_402,6-Sep-15,Nov-14,8,September,November,"I have visited the Taj Mahal twice - once as a kid and once as an adult . The experiences were not vastly different . While I am not taking the beauty and the sheer effort that is gone into building this monument , the sheer commercialisation of services and crowd that is at the Taj Mahal every time is off-putting . With the newer restrictions on entry and exit , the sight seers are detracted from visiting the Taj . Apart from that , there is very little time afforded to the visitors at the dargah itself and therefore , in the hustle of the crowd , you do not end up enjoying your experience . Visit the Taj if it is a must on your bucket lost , and if you want pretty , illusionist pictures for your profile pictures . Else can avoid it . Not exactly worth the money and time spent !",,,,12,"Mumbai, India",India,Rasikha V
Taj_NEU_403,4-Sep-15,Aug-15,13,September,August,"My friends and I arrived at the gates around 11am . Before we left the car he had warned us of the aggressive vendors at the gate . Once you cross the first gate it was about a 10 min walk to the ticket gates . Once we left our driver the vendors & many locals started to bombarding us with offers of being our tour guide a few of them chased us for 3 mins persistently asking us to hire him . After several kind no thank you's we actually had to run away from him for him to get the hint that we did not want his services . Then at the gate another man seemed as if he was part of the ticket line services , but again we were chased by this man asking us to hire him for tour services once again . We bought the tickets and were provided with a bottle of water and shoe covers to be worn inside . Once we went through security check and through the gates the vendors subsided . The views of the monument was breath-taking and we had fun taking lots of pictures . After touring the monument leaving was another ordeal where several vendors would dangle various trinkets inches from our faces . If you were nice and said a friendly no thank you this only encourage them . I felt bad for ignoring the vendors after a while , but even ignoring them one man felt that chasing three girls around a parking lot for a good 10 mins would make us want to buy from him .

Taj_NEU_418,3-Jul-15,Apr-15,15,July,April,"Born and brought up in Delhi , I have always been very close to Agra city . It is only coincidental that I missed all my chances to visit the Indian wonder of the world , The Taj Mahal , and this time around I finally got a chance to visit this beauty and that too combined with some official documentation . There is no doubt and question about the craftsmanship for this architectural delight but I am pained to point out a couple of things which made my heart swell . I would credit all this loathe to the ASI that they chose to differentiate between the Indian visitors and foreigners to such an extent that they surpassed all norms . Some key things which were evidently unplanned for such a monument were The ticket counter looks like you are buying a ticket to death , nobody is visible in the other end of the window No intimation to the visitors that they may have to burn in the love of Mumtaz by going barefoot on the steaming marbles . Tickets for Indians do not include a pair of shoe covers which can save you take off your shoes and burning your feet . The only alternative is small children and a few filthy looking hawkers trying to sell you those shoe covers outside , which a person like me did not trust . apparently , any ticket for non-Indian visitors does come with a shoe cover The sign boards around the complex are fairly discriminatoryThere are no provisions for drinking water apart from the one which is close to the more expensive ticket bearers . Well with all these points that I have mentioned I surely am certain that I am never going to the Taj Mahal again . Therefore I made sure that I do not miss any part of it . I went inside the tomb where intricate exquisite marble work shines across hearts whether young or old . I was mesmerized and wondered how any person can think and plan something that stands so amazing , especially in the time when it was built . I am proud of each person who contributed to building this monument . MY ADVICE TO ALL - EITHER do not BE AN INDIAN AT TAJ MAHAL OR SOULLESSLY BUY CHEAP SHOE COVERS FROM HAWKERS BEFORE ENTERING THE TAJ COMPLEX . MUST CARRY WATER .",,,,4,"New Delhi, India",India,RuchiAggarwal

Taj_NEU_445,17-Apr-15,Oct-14,6,April,October,My family and I were looking forward to seeing the iconic architecture of the Taj Mahal and having endured a 2 hour journey from New Delhi on India's joke road network we finally arrived . Once we were outside the Taj we were told footwear had to be removed and walking barefoot over scorching hot marble because there was no matting in place was painful and at one point I ended up having to carry my youngest children who were in pain because it was like walking over hot coals . Once inside it was nice and cool but as I explained to my children the history of the Taj Mahal I was told by local guides I could not speak - possibly because a number of tourists walked over to listen to me as they could understand my English and not the poor linguistics of the local guides . I ignored them and carried on explaining things to my kids and when I was threatened by one of the local guides I told him where to go in Hindi and he backed off . Inside the Taj is quite small and after 5 or so minutes inside we headed outside to take a few photos before we left . For all of us the Taj Mahal was a bit of a let down and the Golden Temple in Amritsar put the Taj in the shade as India's must see site - OK it is a religious sit which some may not appreciate but for grandeur it knocks the Taj into a cocked hat and the people are so much more friendly .,,,,50,London,United Kingdom,del_singh
Taj_NEU_446,8-Apr-15,Apr-15,21,April,April,"Tuesday 24th March . Le Benz Tour and TravelsA / C Bus tour to Agra and return 6.30 am 11.00 pmWe arrived at the bus stop at 6.25 am excited about the day , to see the Taj Mahal would be something amazing . The bus arrived on time , not a Western style standard bus , but had air conditioning and clean windows . It we sat there waiting for other customers until 7 am . Finally on our way to Agra , bus fully , beautiful hwy , the best in India . Easy to see where the money comes from and is spent . We were met at Agra by our English-speaking guide , we asked him if he worked for the bus company and he replied YES . I also asked at the hotel where we booked the tour was the guide included in the price , he also said YES . So far all OK . We then asked him if we had to pay to get into The Taj , which we did so we asked him to take us to an ATM , unfortunately 2 ATMs later the bank said we had exhausted today limited , not happy with this result ( as this was our first withdrawal today , we will sort it out later ) We had just enough money for the entry tickets and food for the day . He was a lovely guide , organised a TukTuk for us , so away we went . Saw the Taj and then was taken to an over price caf , we left as we was not hungry , then they took as to a marble place , a textile place and a carpet making factory , all of these we did not wish to go to , as we do not buy anything anywhere . ( Hard on two motorbikes to carry anything ) . I know they get paid to take us to these places , seems to be the Asian way . The problem started when the guided tour ended , the TukTuk driver and the guide wanted a tip , not just a small tip somewhere between 1000-2000 INR ( about A $ 20 40 ) , As mentioned we had no money and if we did the asking price was far too high , that was more than we paid for the bus there and back . The guide offered to take us to another ATM , that is when I was not happy . I am understanding this is HOW INDIA WORKS but how rude ! It put a very bad ending to what should have been a memorable day to the Taj Mahal . Anyway back on the bus , alive , saw some temples on the way home , met some lovely people on the bus , but arrived home exhausted at 2 AM not 11 pm . Would we use this company again , as a westerner probably not . PS The Taj Mahal is worth seeing for sure but disappointed that Tourists pay over 10 times more to enter , raciasism at its best .",,,,37,"Mooloolaba, Australia",Australia,Twoxtw

Its in 2km radius of taj . It will cost you Rs 48 / kg . 4 . Buy one day too and fro toll ticket at Rs 575 which is valid for 24 hrs starting from when you buy toll ticket . Otherwise , buy one way ticket ( cost is Rs 360 ) if you are not returning with in 24 hrs . 5 . This is very important . Avoid going on weekend otherwise you will end up spending 6 hrs drive one way . Total 12 hrs drive . I really mean it . You will stuck in Agra city jam and hardly enjoy anything . 6 .

Ok , Let me tell you a very important thing , If you want a place similar to taj ( without 4 pillars of taj and not so huge ) in Delhi with free and unlimited free meal , religious place , with a pond full of beautiful fishes , mouth watering halwa , without any parking or entry ticket and also wanted to avoid long queues the , Hay go to Gurudwara Bangla Sahib CP .",,,,8,none,none,Himanshu M

The guide i took hoping to make things easier got me a photographer who try to rob us forcing us to take so many pictures of us in different poses . Finally i had to tell him that i had enough he just would not let go . He sold them to me a 100 rupees each 35 pics with album as he asked for 4000 rupees i still did not want any trouble so paid the money and went back to our room to find that he has duplicated many pics and most pics are worthless we could have taken better pics with our iphone6 . so do not take a guide and take your own camera . As we were going in the Taj mahal the guide asked us to wear a cover on our shoes and we had to purchase a head cover like thing used by doctors and assistants use in operation theaters in hospitals . While entering i saw many Indians bare feet covered in dust inside there without any type of covering . Next thing the guide told me was that it was prohibited to take pics inside Tajmahal but when we entered there were many Indian people with cameras flashing all around . I asked about it from our guide and he said Indians never change .

The guide explained the cost of tickets . Tourists are charged considerably more than locals . If I recall correctly it is 50 rupees for locals , 750 rupees for tourists . The guide explained that a photographer would walk with us and take pictures and should we were not under any pressure to purchase any . However , once the Bollywood-esque pictures were taken they insisted we buy some . We chose 4 but 10 was the minimum . They lay the pressure on thick and fast ! The Taj Mahal is a beautiful building and great for picture opportunities . I guess if you have seen it once you probably would not want to see it again . Once we left the grounds , the tour guide insisted on staying with us and took us to a place that made decorative ornaments - apparently the makers are the ancestors of Shah Jahan . We learnt later that many tourists are taken there and that there is uncertainty around if they are ancestors of Shah Jahan - please note these marble ornaments although very beautiful are incredibly overpriced .

So you have about 20 seconds inside before you are rushed out . that is unacceptable . it is not like you live in Agra and can visit when you want . Of course you can sit on a bench outside and stay as long as you like . The rushing through the inside is what sort of spoils it . All in all , not worth the price of admission .

Taj_NEU_462,25-Feb-15,Feb-15,32,February,February,"Taj Mahal could have been a better experience had we not met guide and the photographer - Malik , the guide and King Khan - Photographer . We entered Agra and our driver asked us if we would like a guide and we said yes ( believing that being a genuine driver who bought us from Delhi to Agra ) . We were at the entrance and there was this guide Malik - English speaking guide . We asked him about the charge and he was not ready to give us a price and said we can give him anything we wish after he has finished with his services . We haggled a lot with him to tell us an estimate but he would not . Then he introduced us to a photographer King Khan was his name - he also said 100Rs per printed copy of the photograph . We assumed we would click Max 10 photos . Then the game started and we went inside and saw the Taj Mahal and the photographer was making us stand on the backdrop and clicked many photos but it was our choice which we wanted to get printed so we played along . The guide was okay but the information he gave was what we had already read about Taj Mahal , nothing extra . After everything was done , then the photographer said he has clicked 70 photos and that would be Rs . 7000 . We were like What is he talking about - we said we only need 10 . Then he and guide started persuading us and said we can make a package and give you all the 70 in CD and 30 in print and fixed a price of Rs . 3000 ( which is also too much ) but we had no choice . We had not taken our laptop so we did not check the CD there , but when we got back home the CD was empty ? Now , that is what they do in Agra . Please beware ! I never want to go back to Agra and I do not want people to get cheated the way we were being Indians . cannot just imagine , what would they do to the foreign tourists . it is a shame . Then the guide took us to a shop to see inlay work and all marble work and other leather things where he would of course get commission . We skipped a lot of shops he was suggesting because by now we knew of his plan . We did not buy anything as the prices they were quoting were too high - we get Taj Mahal replicas cheaper on Amazon or Flipkart than in those shops . The guide then told us that his charges were Rs . 2000 ( just for 2 hours that we were with him ) . We haggled to Rs . 1500 ( but that too was not worth ) . We were hungry and asked him where we would find good authentic food and he took us to a restaurant ( which was very , very basic only 4 tables ) and we ordered Butter chicken and 2 butter nan that is it and the bill was Rs . 850 ( We could have had at a Five Star hotel ) . Overall , the experience was unpleasant and felt so looted that it overshadowed the grandeur of Taj Mahal and left us with a sour taste of Agra in total . Please say no to any photographer or guide ( Take a book on Taj Mahal instead and do some research before going there ) .

It is impossible to even reach the building without be accosted by dozens of people pushing goods ( and babies ) in your face , selling and begging . The pressure from all of these folks was incredibly stressful , as it was very intimate - we were physically surrounded and had difficulties making our way to the bus .

However , even he had an agenda , wanting to bring the same sellers on to our bus in order to receive a kick back from sales . We loudly declined ! Oh , and the bathroom facilities are woefully inadequate for these crowds . There were 2 western and 3 Turkish style stalls in the ladies room - which meant a 20 minute wait for travelers from any nation .

I had to get out to go to atm and man , everyone was hollering at me , buy this , come here , do this , do that , Over bearing . My mind was so boggled I forgot my atm in the machine . If you knew my job you would know I am no stranger to India's craziest areas . We reached , already had a english speaking tour guide set up by our tour company in the van with us ( Best idea ) . He told us be very weary of everyone . They will try to cheat you badly . Soon as we got out of our van many people came running up . The entrance was so uncomfortable on the side of a busy road . Too many shady looking people eyeing you up . We found a camera man to take our shots . You only buy what pics you like after wards . For all the best shots and he had the best pose ideas we paid him 3K . He wanted 5.5 K for 110 soft copies on CD . 20 rupees for indians . and 750 rupees for foreigners . Rip off . Discrimationation . God forbid they did that in america , people would be going crazy . Last I checked national monuments are one price for all humans in usa . But ok , India is a special country and they are segregating their people into a separate category of lower level . We got in after a few altercations with a few rude people with no manners and guess what was the biggest spectacle . The 8th wonder of the world ( India ) our baby stroller . Everyone was saying this and that , coming up and looking like they were looking at baby stroller trying to touch our baby ( not happening ) . Trying to take pictures of our STROLLER !

Once you enter the premises you are assaulted by a group of guides ( all claiming to be authorized by government ) which hassle you to pick them even if you tell them several times that you are not interested .

To get to the Taj Mahal you have to drive through miles of extreme poverty ( even by India standards ) and cars are not allowed to within about 1 km of the entrance . From the moment I was dropped off at the cordon I was hounded by tour guides . All of them were quick to spout out their government credentials and show their government ID . It seems government IDs in India are all different - shape , color , form , words , etc . Basically all made on the home printer and laminated . Ignore them all . They will follow you but I never once found anyone in India who actually touched you . Even be careful when you get to what seems like official counters . The area where you , as a foreign tourist , pick up your shoe covers and bottled water which are included in your ticket price , is not immune to such ID wielding officials . And those staff who are actually legit seem to work in tandem with those who are not so legit . A tour guide tried to tell me he was included in the ticket price ! The only way to rid myself of him was requesting the armed policeman at the security checkpoint to get the guy to go away . When you exit the Taj Mahal you get all of this chaos in reverse . Keep in mind that if you are non-Indian you pay 750 rupees entry fee , compared to 20 rupees for Indian nationals . At 750 rupees you are known as a high value visitor therefore you get special lines and short-cuts everywhere you go . The 20 rupees ticket holders are somewhat hard done by . Inside the compound its all very nice . Indians not to hot on detail so lawns and gardens are all a bit rough . When you go inside if you are high value ticket holder a staffer will blow a whistle and move other visitors out of the way and give you a guided tour of the inside of the Taj Mahal . Nothing special except you find out at the end he needs to be paid off . Overall , the romantic image of the Taj Mahal is quickly brought down a few pegs when you get there .

Taj_NEU_546,9-Jan-14,,25,January,,"The monument itself is a must-see at least once in a lifetime . It was awe-inspiring and almost breath-taking . We went in a group of 9 first thing in the morning . The crowd was relatively low then and we managed to find a good guide ( by chance ) who helped us to get 8 tickets at local rate and 1 at foreign rate . This was only possible because 8 members of our group looked Indian . Locals are charged Rs . 20 and foreigners are charged Rs . 750 . Massive price difference that was a disappointing start to the visit . We got our tickets quite fast as our guide seemed to have contacts there but by the time we got in the crowd had already built up . Local photographers are in abundance there who will offer to take many photos of your group and have them printed and / or framed at a cost , you can also get a DVD of all your photos . We got a DVD and a printed album of 50 photos for approx Rs . 2000 . Once inside , the experience of Taj Mahal really can be quite dependent on your guide . We found ours randomly on the street outside Taj Mahal and he charged us Rs . 600 for the whole tour plus helping us to buy our tickets . He also got us in through the Foreigner section despite 8 of our tickets being local tickets . We are still not sure what the benefit or difference is between the Foreigner and Local sections . But otherwise , he was a good guide who told us all about the Taj Mahal in excellent detail and in very good English . He also gave us tips on our to handle the beggar children outside which was very helpful . Souvenirs - There is a government approved souvenir shop within the grounds of the Taj Mahal . Get your souvenirs there . Although more expensive , the quality is better by leaps and bounds , and the marble was of a much higher quality than the other shops we visited .

Taj_NEU_547,5-Jan-14,Jan-14,24,January,January,"Despite receiving millions of dollars for renovation and development the Taj Mahal site still does not provide proper access for wheelchair users to the main attraction the tomb itself . There are slopes to other areas but not to the tomb . When we arrived early to avoid the crowds when we got to the tomb itself we found a 7m high ( 22foot ) series of steps onto the main level where the tomb is . When got there the security staff said that we were not allowed up there with the wheelchair . Their excuse was that the wheelchair would because damage to the marble ! The tyres are made of rubber like any show and not made of metal or wood that could scratch the marble ! I explained to the captain that he was breaking by discriminating against disabled people but he was not interested and did not seem to have a clue . When we went to the Archaeological Survey of India office to complain and challenge this illegal and illogical situation we found a different story . I spoke to the main person in charge of the site and he said that they could not provide a slope as it would spoil the site as a 1 / 12 slope would be too long . I told him that we had a right to go up and were prepared to take my wife up the steps ourselves without their help he said that there were safety issues . This was the first sensible thing that I heard . Of course it is dangerous but my wife is small and I am strong so we managed to get her up there but I had to write a letter saying that I would take full responsibility for any injury or accident during this climb ! Typical bureaucratic attitude . Not to help but to cover their backs . Once I had written the letter the boss sent an assistant to get me past the security . Then we had no problem other than the steep and dangerous climb . My wife loved the experience once we were up there but what a pity that it was such a struggle . By the time we got up it was late morning and the crowds had come so it was difficult for a wheelchair user to see anything past the large numbers in the mausoleum . The ASI staffer who helped us was very nice as was the first officer I met in the ASI office . However there are many options on how to get disabled people up to the platform including hydraulic lifts and so on . All around the world similar sites have proper access but India which has a culture of many prejudices against women , disabled and other minorities has no interest in finding solutions only excuses . A law was passed in 1996 that made it compulsory for all publicly accessed places to be free from any barrier for disabled including wheelchair users . Laws in India are eyewash as the privileged corrupt their way out of being accountable for their actions and those responsible for enforcing those laws are not interested in enforcing those laws unless they can make something out of it for themselves .

If you arrive late , then it might be worth skipping the local line . do not throw out the shoe covers if you want to visit the other structures beside the Taj ( there is a garbage bin for them right outside the Taj exit , so it is really annoying if it is your first time there and do not know any better ) .",,,,6,"Toronto, Canada",Canada,MayReyes

Taj_NEU_566,25-Jun-13,May-13,21,June,May,"Seriously , who is going to skip the Taj ? And who is going to rely on Trip Advisor to decide whether or not to go ? You have seen the pictures , it is probably your dream to visit the Taj Mahal , and how can you visit this part of India and NOT see the Taj ? What would the people back home , those who will never visit India , think of you ? So then , that is decided , you are going , right ? So ignore the rest of this review , First off , as a backpacker , the 750 Rupee Foreigner entrance fee is painful - I mean , this is over a day's budget for most of us in India . I assume it is probably this high due to more weathly foreigners flying in , doing the Golden Triangle , and never seeing more of the country . I arrived as early as possible , but even then there were LOTS of people , and this was hardly high-season . Walking around as a westerner you feel you are as much a tourist attraction as the Taj itself - local tourists WILL take many many photos of / with you , and interupt your conversations or musings to do so , which after a while becomes very tiresome . Walking through the archway and getting your first clear glimpse of the Taj is a moment that will stay with you . After that , I jostled for that perfect photo-op with the Taj in the background , and then made my way closer and eventually into the Taj . The inner-sanctum is supposed to be silent , but this is barely enforced , and when I visited it was the domestic tourists who were making the noise , with the tour guides raising their voices over them to be heard . It was also the same people who were taking photos here ( which is not allowed ) - this is enforced - by a guy blowing a whistle . Between the whistle-blowing and and the yelling the atmostphere was shattered . Whether this is the case every day or not , I do not know . On the plus side visiting the Taj allows you to appreciate the majesty and beauty and the details of the architecture close-up , and feels like a once-in-a - lifetime experience to be treasured and remembered . I could never advise anyone against visiting the Taj . But as an experience it falls far short of what it should be . That said , it is still an experience worth having , a wonderful place , and , why are you are still reading ? You KNOW you are going to go . So go .",,,,14,"Cambridge, United Kingdom",United Kingdom,Mark A

They have to learn how to behave with people . YOU HAVE TO BE POLITE . And if you are moving people who are brown skinned than you have to give the same treatment to the White skinned people too . You cannot be racist . I agree that there are hooligans also who come to visit , but i think the management should train their workers to recognise who is a hooligan and who are people who are visiting with their children & trying to give them some lessons about their history . If they do not behave , I seriously doubt that the upper middle class Indian is going to waste their time and energy in visiting their monuments .",,,,2,"New Delhi, India",India,aahan
Taj_NEU_606,20-Aug-12,Aug-12,14,August,August,"You have to be careful while landing in this city and have to plan a lot in advance for every minute detail , if you need to have a good trip to Agra . Inspite of being an Indian , people there will try to fool you around , needless to say what foreigners might have to face . We were a group of six and parked our cars in the parking area in between huge rush , no parking and pathetic roads ( or I must say no roads at all ) . No traffic inspector was there to manage traffic and thankfully we were able to park our cars in 2 hours clearing the 0.5 km stretch - may be the mess was because of a peak hour rush . We took a tanga and asked the driver to take us to TajGanj ( the area which has some descent hotels for having food as per a search over the internet however , he took us to place - Baluganj where he had set commissions with the restaurant owner . We checked the place which was smelling foul and decided to leave without eating there . We took two autos again and asked the driver to take us to a better restaurant . This auto driver also took us to a restaurant - RAJ DARBAR from which he had set his commissions . Needless to say RAJ DARBAR was a filthy and poor place and was quoting rates exorbitantly higher than its standard . AC was leaking water and the restaurant having a very pungent drastic smell . Placing our orders with the rude and uncooperative staff we finally managed to come out of the dirty place after ordering and having small meal there . Finally landed inside TAJ MAHAL which was an amazing treat to our eyes . Will continue onto this review in second part . Thanks for reading .",,,,2,"Gurgaon, Haryana, India",India,Alok A

It is monsoon time in India and it gets very humid because of it . To top it we choose a sunday and we had to push our way amid families to get to the world's most beautiful emblem of love . But for those who still want to visit Taj during this time of the year good news is the awesome Yamuna Expressway is a great drive . Also , if you pay a few extra bucks to touts they lead you to the back of the monument and you will not have to wait in long que to enter . And of course if you can leave early from Delhi say about at 7 in the morning chances are very bright that you will get parking in Taj's parking lot and will not have to park at Agra Fort's parking like we did - pDespite all the sweat we she would and all the chaos the sight of Taj made my heart swell with pride and I will be returning maybe on a working day in Winters .",,,,14,"New Delhi, India",India,Preeti S
Taj_NEU_608,25-Jul-12,Jul-12,41,July,July,"She was built at a time when building technology in India was at its infancy . Back then she must have been a stunning beauty and a unique piece of architecture in the world . Time however is no respecter of beauty or greatness . It had done its deed faithfully with the active co-operation of human indifference . Most people have rightly observed she looks beautiful from a distance . That probably would be true to our own reigning beauty queens fifty years hence . Today the Taj is no different than a faded and fading beauty queen . I went to see the Taj some forty years ago when the present hype was almost non existent . I walked in with my young family and two European friends without any hassle and walked out after spending some hours inside looking at the structure and admiring the marble workmanship in detail . This time round I knew visiting the Taj would be no easy task and my apprehension did prove right . All diesel vehicles have been banned to get close to the monument and so my SUV had to be parked in the parking lot . I had to spend at least Rs . 150 for a to and fro journey from the parking lot to the entrance gate on a battery operated scooter . The entry fee was Rs . 20 for Indians and I am told it is Rs . 750 for foreigners . This phenomenal disparity in the entrance fees structure is deplorable and it is surprising no one in authority seems to give a thought to the unfairness of this tariff . I would refuse to enter any place with such an unreasonable and discriminatory fee structure of this kind whatever may be inside . Being an Indian and having seen the Taj at the throw away price of Rs . 20 it would not be out of place for me to offer some tips to potential Taj visitors . Make sure you have polythene covers for your shoes . If you do not , you will be forced to walk bare foot on the hot and dirty marble floor near and inside the mausoleum . An enterprising lad sells these just near the ticket counter . The operational life of these flimsy bags is not more than a few hundred steps . The ticket counter is near the parking lot and most scooter drivers will oblige and buy the tickets for you . One did it for me . Ignore the self styled government licensed tour guides who will hover around you like flies and also ignore the intrepid sales persons trying to sell you stuff you really do not care for or want to keep , ignore the security guards and turn a blind eye to the security system itself . Endure the disgraceful body search and start walking towards the main gate to the Taj complex as soon as you are set free . Photographing the Taj sans the tourist crowd in the frame can be tricky . You need to be an expert photo editor wizard to get rid of all the offending human beings in the frame . When Emperor ShahJahan built the Taj , the river Jamuna as a backdrop on a full moon night would have been a fantastic scene fit for the gods and some poets . Today the Jamuna is more a canal than a river with patches of sewer water puddles here and there . Any view of the Jamuna from the Taj would be just about satisfactory only on a dark new moon day . do not look too close at anything or photograph the marble floors or walls . The marble floors in some of the hotels you are staying may be a better option ( The marble inlaid inscriptions in the Taj may be an exception to this tip ) . If you are a law abiding citizen just ignore all the law breakers photographing the insides of the mausoleum with impunity or chatting away on their mobile phones . Both these activities are banned according to the warning board in the premises . If you prefer to follow the masses just go ahead but be warned that the authorities are not always in a deep slumber . They could suddenly wake up and slap unpleasant charges on you . The Taj is voted as one of the seven wonders of the modern world and comes wrapped up with a fabulous love story of a powerful despotic emperor and a beautiful gentle queen . It is worth a visit at least once to find out what the hell this ga ga is all about .",,,,280,"Meerut, India",India,tjjohn

Taj_NEU_612,24-Jun-12,Jun-12,9,June,June,i have been to the Taj a few time earlier but the Taj now looks a greyish-creamy color . It looks like it needs a really good scrubbing . The maintenance of the Taj is really poor . Where tiles are broken someone seems to have just fit a piece in there to repair it with no thought or curing of the marble or piece in question . I suggest you see it soon before it gets worse . But if i just look at it without noticing the repairs then yeah its beautiful . I suggest you get there early because as the sun rises the marble absorbs the heat and that can literally burn your feet if you are barefoot . Entrance is Rs 20 for Indians and Rs 750 for foreigners . The Rs 750 i think includes 1 / 2 liter of water and covers for your shoes which you need to enter the main building of the Taj .,,,,35,"Noida, India",India,bawagoldi

But once I reached there , I could not figure out what the hype is about . It is lovely , no doubt about that - but the marble had begun to yellow & I could see stains at some places . It looks beautiful in travel brouchers & TV programs , but it is not as good looking in real life . It was crowded with too many tourists and touts who offer to take you on a guided tour . Please avoid those . You would be better off on your own . There was a wierd smell inside the monument but it was not very bothersome . There are photographers who offer to click instant pictures for you for a price . You have to take minimum 6 pictures & it cost me INR 240 for all . The pictures came out well & it was worth it for me . There is a lane full of souvenier shops , mostly selling marble carved with inlay work . Once you get out of the monument , you will be surrounded with agents who will offer to take you to on of these shops . Nothing will drive them away , you just need to keep walking . If you do decide to go into any of the shops , you need to bargain for a reasonable price . I did go into one of those shops on my own ( without the agents ) & bought two really pretty marble inlay work jewellery boxes . OK for a one time visit given the hype around it .

If you only have one day in Delhi , you could see more than just one attraction and get a better view of the Indian heritage . However , to some extent it might also be depending on the guide you pick . There are many offering their services just outside the Taj Mahal ranking from a recite of the audio tour to great detailed background stories . If you can , stick to a qualified guide through a travel agency . The views are spectacular coming through the gate from the cout yard , however , the actual inside of the building is not that impressive . Especially not when you are hurried through by police officers trying to manage the huge crowds . Friday is closed for renovation and prayers , so ideally come on a weekday at sunrise or sunset as the building looks much more 3D and changes colour . There are toilet facilities inside the Taj Mahal complex , so avoid the public toilets where you purchase your tickets . The tickets for foreigners are 750rps and include shoe covers and a bottle of water . It also allows you to get into a fast late queue at the entrance and when yoiu enter the tomb . Only once a year the actual tomb underground is opened for the public to view on one day as the coffins you see in the main building are replica of the actual ones in the lower grounds of the building . If you want to take in the atmosphere of the building not being stuck in crowds , go the the mosque on the left hand side of the Taj Mahal , sit on the steps in front of the mosque and feel its tranquility .

For example , there is no pretty light at sunrise and sunset because the pollution blots out the sun's rays until it gets high enough in the sky at about 7:30 AM .

Taj_NEU_641,10-Jan-11,Dec-10,27,January,December,"Our visit to the Taj Mahal was an interesting experience . I shall not repeat what the others have said , indeed it is very beautiful and majestic . My complaints are mainly about the way the place is filled with touts , guides , roadside sellers and photographers offering to take your photo . I think the tourism ministry should do something about all this . On our journey to Agra , we were told so much about what to expect that we felt afraid , especially since we were with our two small kids . We were warned that the touts may harrass us and insist that we buy from them . I am not blaming the tour agents for telling us this , as it is all trueWhen we were done , we were warned to be careful when exiting the Taj , as sellers always approach the tourists to buy something and we may end up losing our wallets ! The exit from the Taj to the electric car area is also hazardous . The walkway was filled with people trying to harrass tourists , as a result of which we walked on the road . This may end up in a catastrophe for someone someday , as the autorickshaws and private vehicles drive haphazardly . One question - why are motorvehicles allowed near the Taj when tourists are commuted by electric cars ? This perplexes me ! ( The reason why they use electric cars is because the fumes from the motor engine may spoil the marble , but why is the regulation applicable only to tour vehicles and not local vehicles , I do not understand ) . After you finish at the Taj , you will inevitably be brought to some shops . You do not want a replica of Taj in your house , sir , or Take a piece of Taj with you home . We were taken to a factory producing marble handicrafts with the semi-precious stone inlays . What a rip-off ! If there is one advice I can give you , DO NOT buy the marble handicraft items at these factories . The reason - you can get it at half the price in Jaipur , and since most people do go to Jaipur after their visit to the Taj . You may also get the same items in Agra a bit further away at a cheaper cost . The guides that take you to the factories are actually getting a commission from the total paid . ( We learnt all this the hard way ) . The marble at Agra is Makrana marble , from Rajasthan , not far from Jaipur . The technic of inlaying the stones is actually from Jaipur , I was told . When we went to Jaipur , we went into many shops selling these handicrafts and regretted paying so much for our marble table in Jaipur . So was the Taj lovely ? Yes , if you can put up with all of the above mentioned issues !",,,,151,"Melaka, Malaysia",Malaysia,widespreadvisitor

Taj_NEU_643,10-Apr-10,,11,April,,"It is one of the seven wonders is just magnificient . I still remember the first time I saw Taj , about 14 years ago . At that time , I never thought that I shall be spending 7 years of my life in the same city . I feel the charm of Taj Mahal , lies in the love story attached to its existence & that is a big attraction . Its huge stature leaves you with no words & the white marble coupled with setting sun is quite soothing ( if you happen to visit it during evening ) . The phrases engraved on its wall in urdu / arabic present a contradictory yet pleasant site . However , inside the Tomb its bit damp & you can see the grave of the great Mughal emperor . The gardens ( more of good grass beds ) just in the front of main Tomb are dissected by a good fountain canal worth watching . The most hilarious part of visiting Taj is presented by the photographers who will keep following you to get a picture clicked that too with a special visual effect where in you could see yourself much taller than Taj & that too holding its tomb tip . The river yamuna flowing at the back of the Taj compound has reduced to a mere drainage but still you could see a boat or two rowing from one end to other . I seriously feel that it should have been better had it been more clean .",,,,1,delhi,India,chnsap

Taj_NEU_645,3-Jan-09,,9,January,,"I drove with 3 adults and 4 kids from Noida ( town adjoining Delhi ) to the Taj , a distance of 210 kms and took over 4 hours on December 25 , 08 ( christmas , a holiday ) . The highway is crowded and you can spot a lot of tourists in private taxis and buses during this season going to Agra which adds to the traffic . The monument is SPECTACULAR to say the least and is worth enduring whatever distance one as to travel . What spoils the visit is ( i ) the way the teeming crowds ( Dec 25 being a holiday , fellow Indian's were out in full force ) mill to get in - there can be more and better managed ticket and security checking counters ( ii ) the stink of the approach roads ( it took over 40 minutes to buy tickets and get past security ) ( iii ) visitors touching various parts of the inside of the monument and contributing to the pale yellow / grey colour of the white marble ( there can be a glass walls such that no one touches the marble ) ( iv ) the car parking is a mess to say the least ( we took 30 minutes to get out when we were barely 15 metres from the exit road ) ( v ) guides , camel / horse cart owners and hawkers who stick to you like flies . We and the children did get tired walking and wanted a fast exit . My brother-in-law who has traveled widely and is working in the Gulf was rueing why cannot it be better managed . He opined had the Taj been it been another relatively developed country it would be much better managed and be a money spinner . That is sorely missing . To sum up a great monument but bad management .",,,,13,NOIDA,India,bhargavanoida

Taj_NEU_647,6-Jun-07,,7,June,,"The Taj Mahal is really suffering from age , neglect and pollution . The standard photos in books and post cards are very old and deceiving . I stayed at the Oberois Amarvillas Hotel , which is quite expensive , only because I wanted to enjoy the views of the Taj . I do not think it was worth it and I would recommend staying elsewhere and going over to see the Taj as an afternoon excursion . Better yet , take the one day return trip from New Delhi and do not stay in Agra at all . The color of the Taj is not good , it is chipped up and crumbling , and everyone seems to be in denial about how the neglect is effecting the beauty of this architectural wonder . I was shocked and very disappointed and saddened .",,,,69,Orange County,United States of America,Shojin
Taj_NEU_648,17-Jan-07,,8,January,,"From the onset this was one of the attractions that we really wanted to see . The drive from Delhi is long and was very misty , but the day turned out to be very hot and clear . The Taj Mahal itself is an outstanding building , an architectural marvel and one hell of a monument to a wife ! What a pity then that one has to pay so much to see it - Rs750 per person . Then one has to pay for transport on an electric bus , keeping of shoes , storing a video camera , etc , etc . Once inside you are hounded by official photographers who want to take your picture . Also there are a huge number of visitors so when you eventually get to to go inside the tomb itself , you have to rush through as the attendants shout at you to move on ! Overall not the greatest of experiences but the building is a must see .",,,,83,"Durban, South Africa",RSA,Compass924
