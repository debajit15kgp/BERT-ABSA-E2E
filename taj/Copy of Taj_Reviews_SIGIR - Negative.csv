Taj_NEG_5,10-May-19,Jun-18,14,May,June,"Taj Mahal is my dream place of visit because I read about it since childhood . However , I was disappointed to arrive at a poorly poorly managed location with haze ( from air pollution ) that photos can hardly be clear . Rusty pipes in the pond greets visitors as well as eroded plaques in many places . The worst part is that they charge tourists significantly higher price to enter , as compared to locals . The haze that surrounded the whole region is caused by burning of harvested land hence it can not be cleared in a few weeks . Breathing is difficult as well as allergies , coughing and eyes irritation makes the entire trip miserable . The pictures displayed is not what you get . If you really want to see this piece of history , go prepared with masks , allergy medicine and of course a huge purse . Yes , my most unforgetable / embarrassing experience is being harrassed by the toilet cleaner because I did not have 1 rupee to pay for my toilet visit . When I change money , they give big notes in rupees . Otherwise I only have euros and USD in hundreds . Toilet visits and shoes deposits cost small money BUT they DO NOT give change . Wait for your shoes to disappear , do it on the grass or make sure you have small change . Overall visit is unpleasant despite having to pay exorbitant prices for small gifts because they are trained to add a few more zeros to the back of ticketed items and deny that the tag on that item is the price for locals .","""place of visit""; location, photos;""pipes in the pond"", plaques;charge;haze;Breathing,trip;$;$;experience,""toilet cleaner"";$;$;""Toilet visits"", ""shoes deposits"";$;""overall visit"",prices","1;-1,-1;-1,-1;-1;-1;-1,-1;$;$;-1,-1;$;$;2,2;$;-1,-1","dream;""poorly managed"", ""hardly be clear"";Rusty,eroded;""significantly higher price"";""can not be cleared in a few weeks"";difficult,allergies:coughing:""eyes irritation"":miserble;$;$;unforgettable:embarrassing,harassed;$;$;""cost small money BUT they DO NOT give change"", ""cost small money BUT they DO NOT give change"";$;unpleasant,exorbitant",47,none,none,Yun L

Taj_NEG_14,18-Feb-19,Feb-19,5,February,February,"Our long awaited visit to the magnificent and beautiful Taj Mahal with an excellent and informative guide was truly ruined by seeing the condition of the starved , weak horses slipping and stumbling as they tried to pull the tourist laden Tonga carts on the totality unsuitable marble road surface leading to the front gate . We understand that in India most of the animals are slim and have work to do and we were generally impressed with how the animals were looked after in Rajasthan , however the condition of the horses and donkeys pulling these carts in Agra was very distressing and completely ruined our experience and memories of our visit to the Taj Mahal . Please DO NOT encourage this cruelty and inform your tour operator BEFORE you visit because if you just refuse the ride on the day , the guide and the horse owner will have already been paid . We were too distressed to take photographs of the terrible condition of these horses which we now regret as most also had sores from the harnesses and looked completely emaciated !

Taj_NEG_27,18-Mar-18,Mar-18,31,March,March,"I never wrote a review for my first trip but decided it was necessary for this trip . If you are going with a large guided trip then this may not apply to you but as a small group driving your own car , read on . Firstly , get there as EARLY as possible , the crowd explodes around noon and it is not even pleasant near that time for walking inside the Taj Mahal itself . it is 100 rupees to park at the east or west car park , since the entire area is based on symmetry , they are exactly alike and just go to the one closest for you . You will instantaneously be picked up in the park by a team consisting of an electric bike with driver , and a tour guide . They will take you directly to the Taj Mahal entrance from your car if you so choose , for 100-150 rupees . While on the ride , the tour guide will offer you his services and show you his guide ID card with two different prices , one for Indian and one for foreigners 1,200 , and 2,275 rupees respectively . He will likely offer you the Indian price if you are hesitant , and pretty much force you into buying his services . If it is at peak hours , he really will get you through all of the lines quickly but his pitch about the lower price is a flat out lie and when it comes time to pay he will still charge foreigners price and expect a tip for the VIP package . Both times I went I had that exact scenario . The ticket for entry is 1,000 rupees for North Americans , Australians and Europeans , 550 for Asian and South Americans . Plus 10 rupees per person for shoe covers and a bottle of water . You will then proceed to the Royal Gate and have a little story time outside , then go up to the gate for photos , where you will be swarmed with that tour guides photographer friends to sell you their services , and I mean hounded , then upon entering the courtyard you will again be hounded by photographers every step of the way until about midway to Taj Mahal itself . Up to you if you want it , they give photos in a decent little album after your tour is done , also on CD or USB for varying prices starting near 2,000 rupees . Congratulations , you have made it through the hustlers , for now . But inside the Taj Mahal there will be a security guy on the other side of the fence , he will show you how the marble looks with a flashlight and shout your name so you can hear the echo , then he will expect a small tip for his services , we gave 10 rupees and he was okay with it . After finishing the inside tour , hearing the history and seeing the incredible craftsmanship , which is what you actually came for , including the guest house and mosque , the really negative things begin . The tour guide will immediately begin talking up the 17 generations of craftsmen , this is all to get you interested in their sales , which will be friends of his that he has colluded with to make sales . You will depart through a side gate into the workers colony , which is beyond sketchy ( keep you hand on your wallet and phone pockets at all times here ) . The ATM is conveniently located right out the gate and amid hundreds of people from ages 4 to 104 shouting at you to buy their cups or fridge magnets . This is the art of the tour I tried to avoid the second time but the tour guide will have nothing of the sort . He will take you to a shop where they will try to sell you many things made from marble and pretty stones , which are very nice but I paid 100 US dollars for a 2 inch elephant , after haggling . The prices are absolutely unbelievably high . After leaving the shops things get even more sketchy as the route is full of twists , turns and suspicious looking guys pretending to talk on phones while watching your every more , do not stop , do not talk , just go back to your car . After the exit you will arrive right back at the ticket area and will need to buy another ride back to the car park , and pay your guide . When you get back to the car park the hustlers will try everything in their power to get you to buy ANYTHING , all the way to the car , and at your window . Probably a good time to mention that if you parked in an actual parking space , by now you are very likely boxed in by a parallel parked car , which may or may not be in neutral for you to move it and depart . For us it was luckily the former . All in all the place is lovely . But , the hustlers and hagglers , and general pushiness of everyone to get you to buy extras made us extremely frustrated on both ends of the tour . Outside the Taj Mahal afterwards feels like you are swimming in chummed water during Shark Week , and completely ruins the experience .",,,,5,none,none,Cameron F

Taj_NEG_29,5-Mar-18,Feb-18,89,March,February,"On the whole , India has had more disappointing moments than good vibes , As a South African , when I see tourists or have guests , I try to personally help them have a good time . Thankfully , for tourists in sunny SA , that is usually easy to do .

Then we were told less than a month before our departure that she would not be coming to India after-all , so the reunion plans were also cancelled . We changed our internal flights ( at a fee ) from Amritsar to spend more time in Delhi and Goa , rather than losing more money by cancelling flights and accommodation or being stuck in rural India where the wedding would have been , for 10 days . From day one , the trip became a love / hate expedition . Five days in , until the 2nd day in Goa , it felt more like hard work than a holiday . The scams , haggling and different treatment of tourists - as cash cows - led to a repeated bitter taste compared to the fewer positives ( the food in Delhi was probably of the most flavoursome I have eaten ) . Safe to say that I will not be back in India in a hurry . Not even for a good curry . Even if the postponed wedding becomes a reality . What were the positives - The food and our 5 - star Delhi hotel for the first part of our trip being the two main highlights , there were a few moments like seeing the Taj Mahal and having sundowners with awesome friends on Goan shores that were great . But all the positives except the Taj can be found in other ( more relaxing and cleaner ) holiday destinations . Yes , our pictures are amazing ! We had some great sundowners and lovely sunsets . But often the behind-the-scenes work in creating those positive images were less glamorous . Like the chaos before entering the Taj Mahal with queues , ticket touts , persistent shopkeepers and signage saying that there are free lockers inside the monument , only to be told at the security scanners it is not true - that the guards will confiscate your snacks , books and JBL speaker unless you leave it with one of the persistent shopkeepers and trust that they would give it back to you afterwards . The Polish couple in front of us were just as disappointed that the notebook the girl had written in was not allowed inside . Why ? Its just one of the rules . When we left the Taj , the queues were even longer . Considering we queued for three times the time we spent inside , I was pleased we were first-in and first-out . Like the filthy sleeper train-ride back to Delhi in what felt like a jail cell with barred windows so dirty you could barely see out of them . Like the chaos , litter and rubbish you have to ignore when you make your way to a beautiful 5 - star resort for expensive ( by Indian standards ) sundowners . Perhaps India is not as geared to foreign tourism as South Africa is , perhaps repeat-visits are not encouraged , perhaps the Indian government have not thought about sustainable repeat tourism as an industry to build the economy on . Yes , a few friendly locals crossed our path with advice on what to do not to get ripped off and what the going rate of some things SHOULD be , At our hotel in Goa , Yogesh was the friendliest person we met on our Indian travels - even though we did not book excursions through him , he offered to take my phone to a repair shop and eagerly explained what the items on the repetitive breakfast menu were . What were the biggest negatives - 1 . RipoffsAlthough were savvy travellers and I have travelled extensively , we did not fall foul of the excessive scammers like our seedy taxi driver in Agra who first dropped us at a dodgy hotel then tried to convince us to use his expensive services for the whole day when he pulled to the side of the road in a sidestreet to show us a map and try an elaborate upsell . And the Tourism Office staff in a dodgy side street at Connaught Place in Delhi where they wanted us to cancel our pre-booked train tickets and spend double the time to get to the Taj at double the cost because the ride from Agra station to the monument would take a few hours anyway , when it actually took 20 minutes . But sometimes ripoffs are inevitable when you need a Tuk Tuk late at night and drivers refuse to haggle . You know you are being ripped off before the hotel concierge will laugh and agree at your misfortune , but you just want to get to bed . As a tourist , you must simply be prepared to pay more than locals for anything and everything , unless you go into a supermarket . Or have wifi to order Ubers . Uber is amazing and saved us lots of haggling and destination explanation . You do almost start feeling sorry for the scammers though , because when you see the desperation in traders to sell you something at an inflated price , you realise ( and are sometimes verbally reminded ) of priorities and their livelihood that are at stake . More of a reason to encourage repeat tourism rather than discourage current tourists ? On the beach in Goa , I eventually bought a bracelet for a friend from a tired-looking saleslady - probably exhausted from all the nos of being ignored by tourists on her stint up and down the long beach - and when we discussed having a G&T in her presence , she reminded me that a G&T will cost me three times what I paid for the bracelet and that I should rather give her the money . Reality-check - she probably has many mouths to feed back home and here I only bought one bracelet . Not exactly a ripoff for me , but I felt like Id cheated her out of money even though I supported her . In my run-in with the law in Goa , I was one of a few scooty drivers with a helmet , but still got stopped by the traffic cops ( along with other tourists ) as the locals sped by . Although my drivers licence was fine to hire the bike with , it was not good enough for the traffic officer . I had to then present an Indian-issued international drivers licence out of thin air . I refused to pay a Rs500 bribe so bravely offered to go to the police station with the traffic cop because my drivers licence would not transform into an Indian-issued international drivers licence even if I paid the bribe - and my current licence had been fine in Bali and Thailand too . He then released us . Although many of the potential ripoffs never happened or did not break the bank ( paying Rs1200 for a taxi vs Rs1500 was not going to bankrupt us they were tiring and unnecessary . And if we were not savvy or pushing back and questioning things , they could have cost us more . 2 . ChaosPicture driving on the N1 from Durbanville to Cape Town city centre or the M25 around London . Yes , the congestion is painful and slow especially at rush hour , but cars indicate when changing lanes , mostly keep left and pass right and patiently wait their turn . India is a free-for-all . As long as you can honk your horn , you can drive in the middle of the road and whizz in and out of lanes without checking your blindspot . I am amazed that we did not see more than three accidents . One of which we were involved in - when our taxi drove into the back of a Suzuki Swift throwing us all forward , but the Swift had a protecting metal bar which saved the bumper and we could all proceed after all the bystanders cleared us to proceed on our journey . The impact was hard and I expected a write-off ! You can turn your vehicle without looking for incoming traffic - as long as you hoot . You also have to honk your horn if you stay in your lane so that the vehicles in front of you do not just blindly move in front of you , or so that they know there is something behind them . By vehicles I mean cars , bicycles , taxis , tuktuks , horse-drawn carriages , pedestrians , dogs and the odd cow ( even in central Delhi ) . Perhaps back home were so used to the sound of a horn signalling an imminent accident or dangerous driving , that our stress levels automatically rise when we hear too many hooters . In my experience this holiday , unless you are at an airport , Indians rarely queue , so the night at 10pm when all machines except one ran out of travel tokens on the Metro in Delhi , we had to push to ensure wed eventually get to the front because panic started settling in as to if people would get travel tokens to get home . There was more pushing than at the Taj Mahal when the locals also incorrectly told us we were in the wrong queue . A good side to the chaos was a Delhi Food Tour which took us to dusty Old Delhi where we ate street food at street stalls we would normally have been too scared to eat at . Our guides navigated the streets and chaos for us to ensure we had a good chaotic day at various food stops . 3 . PollutionBlue skies seem a distant memory in India - even in Goa . Constant fires and smog add to the eternal haziness of Delhi and Goa . In the sea , the bathing water is sticky with plastic bags and weird objects floating by . The rust red sand which stains your shoes and nails is apparently from inland mining and construction . The seafood on display in the restaurants does not look appealing and the prawns and calamari I ate were tasteles . Apparently , the seafood quality has deteriorated due to heavily polluted waters and streams and contamination has resulted in todays Goa not having the general appeal of 20 years ago . Perhaps I am spoilt with the seafood we get in SA . Litter lies everywhere and the locals can often be seen dropping their water bottles and plastic wrappers wherever they walk . The beaches are far from being unspoilt with glass and plastic strewn everywhere . Locals do not even dare put their lips onto waterbottles when they drink - it seems that everyone is ultra-careful of getting more germs than necessary in a society where washing your hands with hot soapy water seems to become a luxury for the middle-class . What type of tourists seem to go to Goa - Perhaps a far cry from Goa of 20 years ago , the typical younger foreign tourist visiting Goa today seem to be hippy-types - many dreadlocked , heavily tattooed and multiple body-piercings visitors seemed the order of the day . Otherwise there seemed to be many pensioners ( mostly British or Russian ) who perhaps do not mind the litter and pollution in contrast to the value-for-money deals they could afford here . Or they have been visiting repeatedly , so might not have noticed the deteriorating surroundings over the years . Thick red dust , dirt and grime has not deterred them from coming back from a budget ( but tacky ) destination . Repeat travel - On Wednesday I arrive in Bali for my second visit to Indonesia and I do hope to visit Thailand for a third time next year . I do also still want to visit Vietnam and Cambodia . I came to India with an open mind and am happy to have visited . Perhaps I have high standards and expectations after too many years of travelling . But travelling can never be too much , it opens your eyes so much that you always want to experience more , even with disappointments along the way . Looking forward to the next chapter !",,,,35,"Marsascala, Malta",Malta,JohnT836

We were too distressed to take photographs of the terrible condition of these horses which we now regret as most also had sores from the harnesses and looked completely emaciated !

Inside the monument , a Dante circle of forced rows among soldiers who continually whistle and scream , especially in the room where there are the tombs of Mumtaz and of her beloved husband .

This guy was introducing the place and went on bout the history of the place . it was going well until Then he introduced us to this so called Photographer . Factor 3 - Commisions and PricingIt was raining and this photographer wanted to take shots for us , We were already telling them upfront I have my own camera phone which is already ultra HD and beats a DLSR . We began to sense this is some sort of syndicate here . and the tour guide fella was supporting him . but they were pesistent , we were waiting for at least 40min for the rain to stop , Just SO this guy can get a clear shot . I got pissed off at them saying that I hired this tour guide fella , Not the photographer and we are wasting time . we were still in the courtyard , we have not climbed up n entered the tomb . Factor 4 - Cheating and persistencebut then they began to take photos , then they showed me a preview of all the pics he took . and then he dropped a bomb . I had to pay this guy inr 20,000 just to get 200shots printed in 4R , and will be given a DVD . This really pissed me off i said i will take 5 pics and pay for them and that is IT . their faces changed and they began to hard negotiate with me , then reducing the price from inr 20,000 to inr 8,000 . I knew then these guys are all about money n they are trying to suck me dry . I told them off I do not need anything buzz off . Then to calm me down they said alkright i need to pay only for those 5 pics i chose . they will print it and give it to me later . Factor 5 - More insider commissions and tradesthe tourist guide fella then led us to the monument and then it was going smoothly . he was explaining many things regarding the precious stones and how they could glow in the dark when light shone on them at leadt he proved that . So after the tour , then he brought us down again , and this time he was trying to bring us into this handicraft shop . we knew it was all a ploy and this part of his commissions as well . the guy inside the shop were selling this tiny taj mahals and pottery as well as some precious stones . We were not listening to a word this shopkeeper was saying , we told we needed to go our driver has called us and we need to be going . - Its true our Awesome driver did call us . Factor 6 - Worst experience everafter that , the photographer came with our selected 6 photos , I lost my will to argue , it was 5 but i never gave a damn . he was asking for inr180 for those pics . i told him we needed to take out the cash if there were any atm nearby , the tour guide led us to the atm machines , thankfully it worked then we needed to pay the guide as well . it was truly one of the worst experiences of travelling . Taj Mahal management has to take actions againts these tour guides as they are making it into a tourist trap . the photographers Has to go . they are all overpriced and are all part of the scams . Please do go to this monument , WITH YOUR OWN TOUR GUIDES . NEVER ENTERTAIN ANY OF THE OTHERS THERE . TAKE YOUR OWN PHOTOS do not LET THOSE PESKY PHOTOGRAPHERS TAKE IT FOR YOU . they are ALL SCAMERS . be carefull here . but other than that , please do Enjoy the scenery . the monument is beautifull without doubt . it is romantic as well . never miss it .",,,,10,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Malaysia,Marved78

Got the ticket ( 1000Rp / $ 16 ) , got the electric golf cart to the entrance about a mile away . At the security check they decided that a microphone in my camera bag was NOT allowed in the complex and that I had to return to the ticket office a mile down the road to leave it in a locker . I argued with them to let me just keep it in my bag and they would NOT let me in . Gave my wife my camera to try to get a shot of the TajMahal without anybody in it , and I had to walk the mile back to the ticket office as the electric cars refused to give me a ride ! By this time I am Really MAD at the stupid rules they have that I requested a refund so that I could try to get the sunrise the next day instead , of course they refused that too as the ticket had been stamped BEFORE the frigging security check so I was stuck with a the ticket ! I put the microphone in the a locker and was promptly asked for a tip by the security guy behind the counter ! Had to then walk back to the security check point at the East Gate , and was told the gimbal I had was not allowed in the complex either . I was really upset at this point and I was not going to walk back to the ticket office ! Told them they needed lockers at the check point and not the ticket office and it does not say anything about MicroPhones or Gimbals on their Official WebSite ! It says no Video , but most cell-phones and cameras can take video now , besides the TajMahal is covered in the scaffolding and the there is no water in the ponds so it not exactly interesting to take a photo of anyways ! They eventually let me in and I walked over to the main viewing spot overlooking the TajMahal , and it was crawling with people , like ants everywhere .

I would use stronger words , that rhyme with hit-mole , but this is a public forum . And that is being kind . The Taj is cool I guess . But we took a 4 hour plane and a 4 hour car ride from Chennai ( where we were working ) to get here . Absolutely 0 % worth that effort . So many aggressive merchants , beggars , vagrants , etc . There is actual human waste in the streets . And that is the good parts . Inside of the compound ( after an hour line and some comically stupid security later ) it is just ok . A billion tourists with selfie sticks . The inside of the Taj itself is pretty and cool given the age . However , it is under whelming to be honest . I have been to other wonders of the world and this is dead last . You get hustled in and out of the inside by the crush of humans moving through . After being so annoyed and under whelmed we did not end up exploring much . We just left . Agra Fort is a better experience . Less crowds , great views , and fewer drug addicts , pick pockets , and beggers . Honestly I would not wish the Taj Mahal or Agra on my worst enemy . it is a horribly overrated palace experience .

Taj_NEG_27,18-Mar-18,Mar-18,31,March,March,"I never wrote a review for my first trip but decided it was necessary for this trip . If you are going with a large guided trip then this may not apply to you but as a small group driving your own car , read on . Firstly , get there as EARLY as possible , the crowd explodes around noon and it is not even pleasant near that time for walking inside the Taj Mahal itself . it is 100 rupees to park at the east or west car park , since the entire area is based on symmetry , they are exactly alike and just go to the one closest for you . You will instantaneously be picked up in the park by a team consisting of an electric bike with driver , and a tour guide . They will take you directly to the Taj Mahal entrance from your car if you so choose , for 100-150 rupees . While on the ride , the tour guide will offer you his services and show you his guide ID card with two different prices , one for Indian and one for foreigners 1,200 , and 2,275 rupees respectively . He will likely offer you the Indian price if you are hesitant , and pretty much force you into buying his services . If it is at peak hours , he really will get you through all of the lines quickly but his pitch about the lower price is a flat out lie and when it comes time to pay he will still charge foreigners price and expect a tip for the VIP package . Both times I went I had that exact scenario . The ticket for entry is 1,000 rupees for North Americans , Australians and Europeans , 550 for Asian and South Americans . Plus 10 rupees per person for shoe covers and a bottle of water . You will then proceed to the Royal Gate and have a little story time outside , then go up to the gate for photos , where you will be swarmed with that tour guides photographer friends to sell you their services , and I mean hounded , then upon entering the courtyard you will again be hounded by photographers every step of the way until about midway to Taj Mahal itself . Up to you if you want it , they give photos in a decent little album after your tour is done , also on CD or USB for varying prices starting near 2,000 rupees . Congratulations , you have made it through the hustlers , for now . But inside the Taj Mahal there will be a security guy on the other side of the fence , he will show you how the marble looks with a flashlight and shout your name so you can hear the echo , then he will expect a small tip for his services , we gave 10 rupees and he was okay with it . After finishing the inside tour , hearing the history and seeing the incredible craftsmanship , which is what you actually came for , including the guest house and mosque , the really negative things begin . The tour guide will immediately begin talking up the 17 generations of craftsmen , this is all to get you interested in their sales , which will be friends of his that he has colluded with to make sales . You will depart through a side gate into the workers colony , which is beyond sketchy ( keep you hand on your wallet and phone pockets at all times here ) . The ATM is conveniently located right out the gate and amid hundreds of people from ages 4 to 104 shouting at you to buy their cups or fridge magnets . This is the art of the tour I tried to avoid the second time but the tour guide will have nothing of the sort . He will take you to a shop where they will try to sell you many things made from marble and pretty stones , which are very nice but I paid 100 US dollars for a 2 inch elephant , after haggling . The prices are absolutely unbelievably high . After leaving the shops things get even more sketchy as the route is full of twists , turns and suspicious looking guys pretending to talk on phones while watching your every more , do not stop , do not talk , just go back to your car . After the exit you will arrive right back at the ticket area and will need to buy another ride back to the car park , and pay your guide . When you get back to the car park the hustlers will try everything in their power to get you to buy ANYTHING , all the way to the car , and at your window . Probably a good time to mention that if you parked in an actual parking space , by now you are very likely boxed in by a parallel parked car , which may or may not be in neutral for you to move it and depart . For us it was luckily the former . All in all the place is lovely . But , the hustlers and hagglers , and general pushiness of everyone to get you to buy extras made us extremely frustrated on both ends of the tour . Outside the Taj Mahal afterwards feels like you are swimming in chummed water during Shark Week , and completely ruins the experience .",,,,5,none,none,Cameron F
Taj_NEG_69,12-Mar-17,Feb-17,28,March,February,"ok , so before we went to india , i read some people's negative reviews of the taj and i thought , how is that possible ? but i was overwhelmed and frustrated by our visit . we booked a daytrip from jaipur to see the taj , which included a driver and a guide and stops at a few other places . we arrived around 10am , and the crush of people outside was overwhelming and chaotic , even by indian standards . so many touts and hawkers , and our guide kind of let them attack us , which was not fun . the foreign ticket includes a bottle of water and shoe covers , and the list of what you can bring in is restrictive , so be careful - pack light or leave bags in the car if possible . you will be patted down and walk through a metal detector , and bags will be screened . after getting through the crowd , dealing with hawkers , getting through security , and whatnot , we were already pretty exhausted . then it starts with all the cameramen touts and the tourists - and we were told it was not that busy at the time so i cannot imagine if we had been there at a busy time . our guide was trying to explain how beautiful the building is and that it was built for love , but i just was not buying it - why build it here when she died so far away and already had a tomb ? it seemed to be more about a show of power and wealth , and when i thought of all the chaos , poverty , and desperation outside , and how protected and worshipped this stupid building was , i started to hate being there and just could not see it as beautiful anymore , but as a symbol of everything that was wrong with india - pouring money and jewels into a building while people starve outside . also , whatever else it stands for , it is still a tomb , and the circus-like , consumer-driven atmosphere surrounding it felt wrong . also , our guide kind of took over our camera so we could have the same photos that every other tourist wants i guess - the taj framed in the arch of the entranceway , pretending to hold the top of the tomb - which felt tacky and also limited our personal engagement with experiencing the taj . maybe my line of thinking is unfair - the taj was built a looong time ago , and by people who are no longer in power in india , so maybe its all a moot point , and by paying to see it , im helping those impoverished people . and maybe the guide thought he was being helpful instead of disruptive . i do not know . but i really had a hard time enjoying it or feeling anything positive . it is very small inside the tomb , and the air is rather still , and there are signs to be quiet - but no one is and you are sort of pushed past the replica graves like cattle . it felt claustrophobic and disrespectful . throughout the tour , our guide kept pushing us to go see a marble workshop and learn how they make things like the taj , which was a come on to buy something from a shop he would get a kickback from . i am happy to support local artisans if i want to purchase something , but i did not , so , uncomfortable . the one part i did enjoy was standing on the back of the taj , facing the yamuna river . the river seemed to stretch on forever , and there was a refreshing breeze after the stale air of the inner tomb . also , i had made it through the taj , and it was kind of a relief to know we would be leaving soon . im not going to tell you not to go . maybe im too much of a pessimist to enjoy nice things or was just having a bad day . but i really did not enjoy my visit . i hope you fare better if you decide to go and that this helps you if you are unsure if you want to go .",,,,23,"Baltimore, Maryland",USA,Tracy E

Taj_NEG_29,5-Mar-18,Feb-18,89,March,February,"On the whole , India has had more disappointing moments than good vibes , As a South African , when I see tourists or have guests , I try to personally help them have a good time . Thankfully , for tourists in sunny SA , that is usually easy to do . Tourists to SA pay the same for services , taxis and experiences as our locals and thankfully , rip-offs are rare . they are also made to feel welcome - you would want them to come back . I am grateful for my experiences and senses here in India nonetheless . Somewhat of a if you have not travelled to India , you have not REALLY travelled-scenario . Perhaps I have high standards and yes , this has been the cheapest holiday ever in terms of food and transport ( even with the numerous unwanted tourist rate hikes but cleanliness and pollution is a bigger negative to India . If I were at a different lifestage , pehaps Id feel different . India never made it onto my travel bucketlist until a good friends wedding invite for her wedding . Then we were told less than a month before our departure that she would not be coming to India after-all , so the reunion plans were also cancelled . We changed our internal flights ( at a fee ) from Amritsar to spend more time in Delhi and Goa , rather than losing more money by cancelling flights and accommodation or being stuck in rural India where the wedding would have been , for 10 days . From day one , the trip became a love / hate expedition . Five days in , until the 2nd day in Goa , it felt more like hard work than a holiday . The scams , haggling and different treatment of tourists - as cash cows - led to a repeated bitter taste compared to the fewer positives ( the food in Delhi was probably of the most flavoursome I have eaten ) . Safe to say that I will not be back in India in a hurry . Not even for a good curry . Even if the postponed wedding becomes a reality . What were the positives - The food and our 5 - star Delhi hotel for the first part of our trip being the two main highlights , there were a few moments like seeing the Taj Mahal and having sundowners with awesome friends on Goan shores that were great . But all the positives except the Taj can be found in other ( more relaxing and cleaner ) holiday destinations . Yes , our pictures are amazing ! We had some great sundowners and lovely sunsets . But often the behind-the-scenes work in creating those positive images were less glamorous . Like the chaos before entering the Taj Mahal with queues , ticket touts , persistent shopkeepers and signage saying that there are free lockers inside the monument , only to be told at the security scanners it is not true - that the guards will confiscate your snacks , books and JBL speaker unless you leave it with one of the persistent shopkeepers and trust that they would give it back to you afterwards . The Polish couple in front of us were just as disappointed that the notebook the girl had written in was not allowed inside . Why ? Its just one of the rules . When we left the Taj , the queues were even longer . Considering we queued for three times the time we spent inside , I was pleased we were first-in and first-out . Like the filthy sleeper train-ride back to Delhi in what felt like a jail cell with barred windows so dirty you could barely see out of them . Like the chaos , litter and rubbish you have to ignore when you make your way to a beautiful 5 - star resort for expensive ( by Indian standards ) sundowners . Perhaps India is not as geared to foreign tourism as South Africa is , perhaps repeat-visits are not encouraged , perhaps the Indian government have not thought about sustainable repeat tourism as an industry to build the economy on . Yes , a few friendly locals crossed our path with advice on what to do not to get ripped off and what the going rate of some things SHOULD be , At our hotel in Goa , Yogesh was the friendliest person we met on our Indian travels - even though we did not book excursions through him , he offered to take my phone to a repair shop and eagerly explained what the items on the repetitive breakfast menu were . What were the biggest negatives - 1 . RipoffsAlthough were savvy travellers and I have travelled extensively , we did not fall foul of the excessive scammers like our seedy taxi driver in Agra who first dropped us at a dodgy hotel then tried to convince us to use his expensive services for the whole day when he pulled to the side of the road in a sidestreet to show us a map and try an elaborate upsell . And the Tourism Office staff in a dodgy side street at Connaught Place in Delhi where they wanted us to cancel our pre-booked train tickets and spend double the time to get to the Taj at double the cost because the ride from Agra station to the monument would take a few hours anyway , when it actually took 20 minutes . But sometimes ripoffs are inevitable when you need a Tuk Tuk late at night and drivers refuse to haggle . You know you are being ripped off before the hotel concierge will laugh and agree at your misfortune , but you just want to get to bed . As a tourist , you must simply be prepared to pay more than locals for anything and everything , unless you go into a supermarket . Or have wifi to order Ubers . Uber is amazing and saved us lots of haggling and destination explanation . You do almost start feeling sorry for the scammers though , because when you see the desperation in traders to sell you something at an inflated price , you realise ( and are sometimes verbally reminded ) of priorities and their livelihood that are at stake . More of a reason to encourage repeat tourism rather than discourage current tourists ? On the beach in Goa , I eventually bought a bracelet for a friend from a tired-looking saleslady - probably exhausted from all the nos of being ignored by tourists on her stint up and down the long beach - and when we discussed having a G&T in her presence , she reminded me that a G&T will cost me three times what I paid for the bracelet and that I should rather give her the money . Reality-check - she probably has many mouths to feed back home and here I only bought one bracelet . Not exactly a ripoff for me , but I felt like Id cheated her out of money even though I supported her . In my run-in with the law in Goa , I was one of a few scooty drivers with a helmet , but still got stopped by the traffic cops ( along with other tourists ) as the locals sped by . Although my drivers licence was fine to hire the bike with , it was not good enough for the traffic officer . I had to then present an Indian-issued international drivers licence out of thin air . I refused to pay a Rs500 bribe so bravely offered to go to the police station with the traffic cop because my drivers licence would not transform into an Indian-issued international drivers licence even if I paid the bribe - and my current licence had been fine in Bali and Thailand too . He then released us . Although many of the potential ripoffs never happened or did not break the bank ( paying Rs1200 for a taxi vs Rs1500 was not going to bankrupt us they were tiring and unnecessary . And if we were not savvy or pushing back and questioning things , they could have cost us more . 2 . ChaosPicture driving on the N1 from Durbanville to Cape Town city centre or the M25 around London . Yes , the congestion is painful and slow especially at rush hour , but cars indicate when changing lanes , mostly keep left and pass right and patiently wait their turn . India is a free-for-all . As long as you can honk your horn , you can drive in the middle of the road and whizz in and out of lanes without checking your blindspot . I am amazed that we did not see more than three accidents . One of which we were involved in - when our taxi drove into the back of a Suzuki Swift throwing us all forward , but the Swift had a protecting metal bar which saved the bumper and we could all proceed after all the bystanders cleared us to proceed on our journey . The impact was hard and I expected a write-off ! You can turn your vehicle without looking for incoming traffic - as long as you hoot . You also have to honk your horn if you stay in your lane so that the vehicles in front of you do not just blindly move in front of you , or so that they know there is something behind them . By vehicles I mean cars , bicycles , taxis , tuktuks , horse-drawn carriages , pedestrians , dogs and the odd cow ( even in central Delhi ) . Perhaps back home were so used to the sound of a horn signalling an imminent accident or dangerous driving , that our stress levels automatically rise when we hear too many hooters . In my experience this holiday , unless you are at an airport , Indians rarely queue , so the night at 10pm when all machines except one ran out of travel tokens on the Metro in Delhi , we had to push to ensure wed eventually get to the front because panic started settling in as to if people would get travel tokens to get home . There was more pushing than at the Taj Mahal when the locals also incorrectly told us we were in the wrong queue . A good side to the chaos was a Delhi Food Tour which took us to dusty Old Delhi where we ate street food at street stalls we would normally have been too scared to eat at . Our guides navigated the streets and chaos for us to ensure we had a good chaotic day at various food stops . 3 . PollutionBlue skies seem a distant memory in India - even in Goa . Constant fires and smog add to the eternal haziness of Delhi and Goa . In the sea , the bathing water is sticky with plastic bags and weird objects floating by . The rust red sand which stains your shoes and nails is apparently from inland mining and construction . The seafood on display in the restaurants does not look appealing and the prawns and calamari I ate were tasteles . Apparently , the seafood quality has deteriorated due to heavily polluted waters and streams and contamination has resulted in todays Goa not having the general appeal of 20 years ago . Perhaps I am spoilt with the seafood we get in SA . Litter lies everywhere and the locals can often be seen dropping their water bottles and plastic wrappers wherever they walk . The beaches are far from being unspoilt with glass and plastic strewn everywhere . Locals do not even dare put their lips onto waterbottles when they drink - it seems that everyone is ultra-careful of getting more germs than necessary in a society where washing your hands with hot soapy water seems to become a luxury for the middle-class . What type of tourists seem to go to Goa - Perhaps a far cry from Goa of 20 years ago , the typical younger foreign tourist visiting Goa today seem to be hippy-types - many dreadlocked , heavily tattooed and multiple body-piercings visitors seemed the order of the day . Otherwise there seemed to be many pensioners ( mostly British or Russian ) who perhaps do not mind the litter and pollution in contrast to the value-for-money deals they could afford here . Or they have been visiting repeatedly , so might not have noticed the deteriorating surroundings over the years . Thick red dust , dirt and grime has not deterred them from coming back from a budget ( but tacky ) destination . Repeat travel - On Wednesday I arrive in Bali for my second visit to Indonesia and I do hope to visit Thailand for a third time next year . I do also still want to visit Vietnam and Cambodia . I came to India with an open mind and am happy to have visited . Perhaps I have high standards and expectations after too many years of travelling . But travelling can never be too much , it opens your eyes so much that you always want to experience more , even with disappointments along the way . Looking forward to the next chapter !",,,,35,"Marsascala, Malta",Malta,JohnT836

Taj_NEG_80,22-Oct-16,Oct-16,21,October,October,"One of the worst experiences we have had in India thus far . We booked Agra bus tickets through a travel agent . The ticket price was 600 RS per person , 1200 in total for up and down . The ticket said it would pick us up from the place near to our New Delhi hotel at 6:15 am . But the bus came around 8ish . Though our tickets was for New Delhi - Agra - New Delhi , the travel agent did not tell us that it would take us to Mathura and Brindabon ( Two pilgrimage sites of Hindus ) . We were so shocked to find out about this ! We could not even see the Taj and Agra fort properly as the bus people only gave an hour to visit ( as they had to run off to those holy places ) . Being a foreigner who has no interest in Hinduism , I along with my family had to visit scary alleys of Mathura and Brindabon at 1AM in the night . What was supposed to be a simple bus ride to see Tajmahal , ended up being a 24 hours of nightmare . I was not the only sufferer , I saw many other foreign tourists who were going through the same nightmare . Tourists need to be aware of such touts while travelling that is why I thought it was necessary to review Taj . So pointers if you want to visit Taj - 1 ) do not go by bus or a travel agent . Bus company have contract with shops for food and souvenirs . They will spend hours in these shops rather than showing you the actual Taj . Best solution - Hire a taxi . it would be expensive , around 6 to 7 thousand rupees but will be worth every penny . 2 ) do not visit on Sunday . it is crowded . 3 ) Security is excessively tight . you are going to have to pay for your handy camera .",,,,2,none,none,Trina M

We were encouraged to see it early in the morning light but I suspect this was to ensure more visitors got in . Certainly there was no advantage as far as the quality of light was concerned . The problem lies in the pollution which Agra suffers from . The result is that you view this iconic building through a haze of smog - scarcely the romantic image you have taken from so many earlier photographs . In addition , comments regarding the poverty apparent to the rear of the Taj Mahal proved less accurate - my angst was more to do with the rubbish and other detritus that had been allowed to accumulate . All this might have been excusable when India was impoverished , but as a proud , independent , democratic - and relatively well off country - it should get its act together and sort these problems out !

We came across this tourist rate issue so many times in India , that time and again we found ourselves deciding it was just too much to pay . At other sites , the student rate for foreign tourists was denied to our children ( all under 18 ) because we did not have an official card to prove that they were still at school ( obligatory at their ages in our country ) . Highly frustrating . One reason we went to India was to enjoy a relatively cheap trip .

Taj_NEG_102,5-Jun-16,Jun-16,31,June,June,"Disappointing is the adjective that sums up the Taj Mahal experience . The architecture is great , the story interesting but that is where the romantic notion stops . The whole experience is marred by the people who just do not care about anything but money , from the government to the grounds staff , no one has any sense of pride in their work , the Taj Mahal or the guests who are lining their corrupt pockets . 1000 rupees per person to go in to visit the Taj Mahal , we visited at 0600 to see the sunrise via the East Gate . Our pre arranged taxi did not turn up , so we asked Security at our hotel ( Marriott Courtyard ) to call us a tuk tuk . Immediately we had a lift and for 300 rupees return , we were sorted cheaper than the taxi who wanted to charge double for the 3km return journey ) . After buying our ticket from the booking office ( approx 700m from the entrance collecting our included bottle of water and shoe covers ( which must be worn in the mausoleum ) and took a rickshaw to the entrance for 100 rupees each way . We did not try bartering with either of our two drivers as it was still cheaper than the taxi driver . Unfortunately , opportunists are everywhere trying to get you to buy their services for a photo , their rickshaw ( even though you have one a tour , a souvenir , clothes etc . Having to repeatedly say no thank you is exhausting and frustrating , especially when you are not being listened to but just harassed . Upon entry , you go through security , metal detectors and X-Ray for bags . Men on right , women on left side . More photographers and guides ( official / unofficial you cannot tell and apparently a lot of ID is fake not that I would know what I am looking at in the first place ) ! trying to get you to buy their services . The view is lovely with the garden and water fountains before you leading to the mausoleum . When you near the steps to the mausoleum , you have to put your shoe covers on ( or remove your shoes altogether ) . it is not the sun coming over the horizon that you see but the sun climbing up into the sky . As one should have realised , this gives a very slight yellow ( golden is a bit poetic license ) tinge to the marble , although the semi precious stones that are the flower art work do glint in the light . Inside the mausoleum it is dark and difficult to see the artwork clearly Pay close attention to the rules . Only take a camera , phone and water with you . More than likely you will be made to dispose of anything else ( or go back to the booking office to store in a locker that is limited and on a first come , first served basis ) . The lack of care is sad to see . There are shoe covers and water bottles disregarded all over the gardens ( the majority of national people seem to think littering is acceptable why these cannot be disposed of carefully or picked up by the grounds staff ( instead of them trying to point you to the best vantage point then asking for tips ) is just thoughtless and lazy . On the return , ( as previously mentioned ) you are harassed , however , the rickshaw and tuk tuk drivers we had were polite , courteous and reliable . The hype of the Taj Mahal exceeds the reality . We have visited Humayun's Tomb in Delhi and the mausoleums within Lodi Gardens that are also in Delhi that are equally beautiful if not quite as well renovated . Yesterday we took said taxi that let us down this morning to the other side of the Yamuna river for a view at sunset for 600 rupees return . 200 rupees each to get into Mehtab Burj ( ruins of a supposed planned black Taj Mahal for emperor Shah Jahan ) so that we could see the Taj Mahal as the sun set . It was ok but did not WOW us . My advice is to read up on the history before you go rather than hire a guide and save yourself 1000 rupees .

With similar number in Europe riots would have erupted , and only the patience of the Indians allowed them to endure long queues that Europeans jump , as they pay a ticket far more expensive than theirs . Inside the monument , a Dante circle of forced rows among soldiers who continually whistle and scream , especially in the room where there are the tombs of Mumtaz and of her beloved husband . The site is in the hands of the military , I suppose for anti-terrorism reasons . On the river a fence with barbed wire should perhaps prevent terrorist attacks . Meanwhile , the charm of the most beautiful monument in the world has set forever .",,,,23,"Alba, Italy",Italy,296robertob

As a foreigner you could be forgiven for thinking the listed prices on their sign are ACTUALLY options ! Nope . A one way trip to the taj mahal is listed at 100 rupees - but you are not getting that . They tried desperately to sell us the 8hr , 600 rupees package that most foreigners want , but it did not suit our schedule . When they could not , they added an arbitrary 10 rupees to our fee claiming it was a service charge . No-one who got the 600 rupee service has to pay it , and on your receipt they will still write 100 . Negligible money I know , but it is the principle . Either get a pen and write 110 over it ( they need the receipt back after the journey ) or do what I did and rip the yellow receipt up in front of them as you walk away . Taj Mahal itself ?

The entire experience was appalling and we were so angry with how we were treated , that it almost ruined our visit . We are a family of Indian descent but are 5th generation South African , that being said , I do not speak a word of Hindi . Trying to enter the Taj , there is 2 lines , a tourist line and a national line . The security personnel saw us in the tourist line ( which is significannotly shorter than the line for nationals ) and screamed for us to get to the back of the national line , based on her assumption that we were nationals . We explained that we were foreigners and we were in the correct line , after which we were mocked and met with laughter for the fact that we were Indian's speaking English . All backpacks have to go through a security check before entering the Taj . The security felt the need to allow every other foreign tourist through without checking their bags but just had to stop our family and critically check each of us . In my backpack , I had a sample of my wedding invitation . They found this and started shouting at me and demanded that I throw it in the trash . We could not understand why , they were literally just giving us a hard time for no reason . Our tour guide had to intervene to stop the security from their absolutely psychotic behaviour . The security personnel need to seriously re-evaluate their attitude and how they treat tourists , irrespective of what I look like or where I am from , I deserve to be treated with respect , especially if I am prepared to visit your country and bring in money to support tourism .

First a tried the moon light visit , only 50 people at a time . Unfortunately it was a rainy night and you only get to look at the Taj from a distance like in the picture . There was no lighting so it was virtually impossible to see the Taj at all . That combined with the humidity and the overwhelming security made it feel like a waste of money and time . Figured it would be better in the day . So went back the next day . Security was lighter and the outside proportions and color of the Taj are attractive despite the obvious poor restoration attempts in some of the arches . The inside was not lit and access to the impressive peitra dura was blocked by the teaming crowds of tourists as well as security cameras . Access to the lower floor and the actual tombs with the finest artwork was completely walled off .

From hotel till this place it was ok-ok as I commuted using vehicle . Vehicle dropped me before a river bridge and advised me to go by walk as there will be too much crowd . I tried to capture few moments with my camera and then I found , entire river bank is filled with people and cleaning their buffaloes . Suddenly I got surrounded by kids and asking for money . Anyhow I managed till taj . On entry , monument staff offered me 2 non-woven-cloth bag which to be worn in foot . Later I found the monument itself dirty enough that there is no need to use those bags . Over to that few police personal were roaming wearing their shoes only . On the path to tajmahal there is a alley which suppose to be filled with water and lotus flowers ( as per pics I saw in books was completely dry and mud filled . On moving to alley so called GUIDES started chasing me . Most disgusting thing came out when one person asked me ARE YOU MUSLIM ? and with his cheap smile with white cap on head he was trying to show that he is best ( indeed he was looking like jerk ) . Finally I reached to main building . Instead of white , the marble was yellow with dirt settled in fine engravings . The most funny part , at few places I saw it was written using coal / white chalk loves ( blanks are filled with name of boyz and galz ) . The back part of monument was very good which offer a calm view of Yamuna river . Inside the mosque , it was crowded and smelling bad . There was no ventilation . Finally I moved out of that . I came out of premises and ignite a cigarette , and continued thinking , why it is known as symbol of love .

Taj_NEG_56,18-Jun-17,Jun-17,53,June,June,"The world will always remember this Wonder of the world . The levels of anticipation for our tour here should have been most memorable . But our visit here turned out to be downright dissapointing and left us so sour . Factor 1 - Bad WeatherYes , it was unbelievably raining and it was on the Very Early morning , around 7am durng summer , which is largely unheard of . But Am not complaining due to the weather , actually it was cooling . Rain or shine i did not care that much cos this is The TAJ MAHAL . Factor 2 - Tour Guides forcing tourist to hire them . The main reason why im rating it low was due to the very bad management for this monument AND MY VERY BAD EXPERIENCE THERE . There was this guy that was so gracious and polite that led us to the ticketing counter to get our tickets . we were thinking Wow now This is customer service . after buying our tickets this same guy then drew out his card saying that he is a registered Tour Guide from India ministry of tourism . And that is when things went downhill . Factor 3 - So called pro Phtographers Tourist TrapsSince he was there , we thought yeah a bit of background info of this monument would not hurt so we hired him to be our tour guide . This guy was introducing the place and went on bout the history of the place . it was going well until Then he introduced us to this so called Photographer . Factor 3 - Commisions and PricingIt was raining and this photographer wanted to take shots for us , We were already telling them upfront I have my own camera phone which is already ultra HD and beats a DLSR . We began to sense this is some sort of syndicate here . and the tour guide fella was supporting him . but they were pesistent , we were waiting for at least 40min for the rain to stop , Just SO this guy can get a clear shot . I got pissed off at them saying that I hired this tour guide fella , Not the photographer and we are wasting time . we were still in the courtyard , we have not climbed up n entered the tomb . Factor 4 - Cheating and persistencebut then they began to take photos , then they showed me a preview of all the pics he took . and then he dropped a bomb . I had to pay this guy inr 20,000 just to get 200shots printed in 4R , and will be given a DVD . This really pissed me off i said i will take 5 pics and pay for them and that is IT . their faces changed and they began to hard negotiate with me , then reducing the price from inr 20,000 to inr 8,000 . I knew then these guys are all about money n they are trying to suck me dry . I told them off I do not need anything buzz off . Then to calm me down they said alkright i need to pay only for those 5 pics i chose . they will print it and give it to me later . Factor 5 - More insider commissions and tradesthe tourist guide fella then led us to the monument and then it was going smoothly . he was explaining many things regarding the precious stones and how they could glow in the dark when light shone on them at leadt he proved that . So after the tour , then he brought us down again , and this time he was trying to bring us into this handicraft shop . we knew it was all a ploy and this part of his commissions as well . the guy inside the shop were selling this tiny taj mahals and pottery as well as some precious stones . We were not listening to a word this shopkeeper was saying , we told we needed to go our driver has called us and we need to be going . - Its true our Awesome driver did call us . Factor 6 - Worst experience everafter that , the photographer came with our selected 6 photos , I lost my will to argue , it was 5 but i never gave a damn . he was asking for inr180 for those pics . i told him we needed to take out the cash if there were any atm nearby , the tour guide led us to the atm machines , thankfully it worked then we needed to pay the guide as well . it was truly one of the worst experiences of travelling . Taj Mahal management has to take actions againts these tour guides as they are making it into a tourist trap . the photographers Has to go . they are all overpriced and are all part of the scams . Please do go to this monument , WITH YOUR OWN TOUR GUIDES . NEVER ENTERTAIN ANY OF THE OTHERS THERE .

Why ? They did not read the sign and decide it was a bad message ( happy birthday ) ? We had about 45 minutes to get into the place by this point so there was no time to argue . In the bin . I am sure the soldiers at the gate were shaking us down for a bribe , we would not give them the satisfaction . Honestly , we expect touts and those who profit from tourism , but not this kind of treatment from the police or armed forces . What scum . Paper and cardboard are no risk to safety , we would have happily held onto them and brought them back out with us so we were not putting undue strain on the bins inside , bureaucratic nonsense . The numbers of tourists were immense by the time we got inside . Fair enough , it is a world wonder . But for all this money coming in , why is it being so poorly managed ? A bloody cloak room is not a hard thing to administer , it would have made everything about our visit easier and more enjoyable . it is a shame that the administrators of this amazing site think of foreign tourists as cash cows with no need for pleasant treatment .",,,,77,"Wollongong, Australia",Australia,445patrickh
Taj_NEG_149,29-Jun-15,Jun-15,12,June,June,"I visited the Taj with a group of friends and our friend from Delhi . The Taj is something that was on each of our bucket lists , and I can say that it fell completely short of any expectations . Here's why - Getting There It is a brutal drive from Delhi because of city traffic . There is little to do in Agra , which is a very poor , dirty city located near the Taj When you arrive on grounds , tuk tuk and camel drivers will swarm you to have them take you from the parking lot to the entrance gate 200 meters ) . - You will also be solicited by street vendors and children trying to steal your bags or beg for money . MIND YOUR BELONGINGS . At the Taj You will take some beautiful photographs Photographs you could have seen in a magazine rather than endure + 100 degree temperatures and hoards of people for There are no restrooms All you can do is walk the grounds , walk inside the mausoleum , and walk into the mosques on either side of the main building . Let me emphasize - ALL you can do is WALK AROUND The buildings are beautiful , and the stories and legends behind it make it enchanting , but the actual visit itself is lackluster As a foreigner , we as both in a group and individually were approached by dozens of Indian families and for pictures . In the two hours we spent there , we hard our pictures taken by + 20 Indians / families . Other Details As a small aside , unlike other historic monuments , the Taj does not have anything to describe what you are seeing ( i.e. tours , brochures , plaques ) . There are literally only the grounds , and nothing else , so read up before you visit Bring water with you . There is nothing sold on the grounds , so you will regret not having something to drink with you before venturing out .",,,,24,"Charlotte, North Carolina",United States of America,WorktoWeekend

Got the ticket ( 1000Rp / $ 16 ) , got the electric golf cart to the entrance about a mile away . At the security check they decided that a microphone in my camera bag was NOT allowed in the complex and that I had to return to the ticket office a mile down the road to leave it in a locker . I argued with them to let me just keep it in my bag and they would NOT let me in . Gave my wife my camera to try to get a shot of the TajMahal without anybody in it , and I had to walk the mile back to the ticket office as the electric cars refused to give me a ride ! By this time I am Really MAD at the stupid rules they have that I requested a refund so that I could try to get the sunrise the next day instead , of course they refused that too as the ticket had been stamped BEFORE the frigging security check so I was stuck with a the ticket ! I put the microphone in the a locker and was promptly asked for a tip by the security guy behind the counter ! Had to then walk back to the security check point at the East Gate , and was told the gimbal I had was not allowed in the complex either . I was really upset at this point and I was not going to walk back to the ticket office ! Told them they needed lockers at the check point and not the ticket office and it does not say anything about MicroPhones or Gimbals on their Official WebSite ! It says no Video , but most cell-phones and cameras can take video now , besides the TajMahal is covered in the scaffolding and the there is no water in the ponds so it not exactly interesting to take a photo of anyways ! They eventually let me in and I walked over to the main viewing spot overlooking the TajMahal , and it was crawling with people , like ants everywhere . Spent the next 2 - hrs trying to find my wife in the complex , so did not see ANY OF THE COMPLEX ! A very big 100 % waste of time and money .

Do not get a guide ( most are fake guides they will show you a fake ID pretending they are official guides where there are only few handy official guides ) and do not buy any souvenir ( everything is a rip off , they will tell you gov prices etc , what is a basic miss information ) any quoted tuktuk price give them only 30 % of what they ask for ask they take a laugh out of tourists .",,,,93,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,Gandalfquest

Agra , what a mess . One of the seven wonders made me wonder where all that tourist money was going to , because it was certainly not going back to the city , Agra is a terrible dirty poor place , neither was it going back to conserve the reason why the Taj was placed there - because of it is majestic scenery , which is now a dirty river with not much water left in it , and the horrible city smell .

We never got one , nor wanted one , but you should know this - this guy , probably with a fake government tourist guide ID , approached us and quoted us with 1200 rs for his services , saying it was a really cheap indian price . We insisted we did not need him and just kept walking and he followed us and his offer was gradually , but quickly going down to 300 rs . Then he finally got it and stopped following us . Now to the other things - just before we got our tickets , they did not want to let us go further because we had small backpacks . They checked the contents and said it was ok and let us go . After we got the ticket at an exorbiant rate of 750 rs per person we had to go through security screening again . We had to put our bags through an xray machine and then they searched them again - taking everything out and inspecting and touching every little item in it .

My gripe is the Taj gets 35000 visitors per day , Indian nationals pay r20 and foreigners pay r750 if you say 20000 are foreign visiters The Taj Mahal reaps in over r150,000 per day or to us Brits 150,000 PER DAY . From the entrance at the roundabout when you get of your coach or taxi you will be greeted by the stench of very stale urine from the very unkept camels and horses not to mention the piles of crap all over the place , once you recover from the smell all the touts and guides will hastle you to death . Just ignore them and walk the 200m down a road which is like waking through a building site , its a disgrace . Why cannot the use some of the 1,000 , 000 a week to give visitors a nice experience from start to finish . I wonder where the money goes ? You do not need a guide but beware , to enter The Taj you will go through a metal detector and any bags you are carrying will be x-rayed this is where the fun begins . When your bag is x-rayed the Army checkers will rumage through your bag and pick thing out that they will say are not allowed , i had a portable radio , a torch , my mobile phone charger , a mini tripod for my camera removed from my bag NOT ALLOWED you have a choice now they throw it in the bin at the checking station or you take them back so you can walk back 500m to a locker room where you can pay r30 for then to go in an open shelve till you get back . When you get back to the x-ray checking area another Army checker might take a fancy to something else so be warned , it is daylight robbery , even cigarettes were being removed NOT ALLOWED Please enjoy The Taj , it is amazing .",,,,196,"Bradford, United Kingdom",United Kingdom,jim-on-the-run

I had tremendous expectations from this monument as i had read about it in school and how it was the epitome of love , not to mention being classified as one of the 7 wonders of the world . What turned me off initially , was the fact that foreigners are treated differently there , they have to pay 10 times the entry fee that an Indian pays to enter the Taj . This is pure discrimination and that too against people who bring in maximum revenues for the tourism industry in India ! The area around the Taj is quite good and well maintained , but when i got to the actual structure itself , it appeared to be yellowing with age and the ASI were doing some work on restoring the fascade in places where the building appeared to be crumbling . I entered the Taj and was pushed by the security to make a move on , i walked around the monument in a circle , and that was it ! Nothing more to see ! It was a total dampner , apparently people are not allowed on the lower floor of the Taj due to vandalism and the like . It was very disappointing that all i got to see was a few precious stones which were embedded in the marble . The searing heat was kept out and i felt quite cool inside the taj , but nothing else to write home about . The shopping centers around the taj are total rip-offs and should be avoided . Also , the local rickshaw guys try to pull a fast one on you if you look remotely foreign ( or dressed in shorts for that matter ) . All in all , it was a very disappointing visit for me . All i can say is , go there with 0 expectations and you will like the place , if you have any kind of expectation before you visit the taj , you will not like it .",,,,43,"Bangalore, Karnataka, India",India,micky1234567890

Once you reach there , parking is haphazard , you are charged parking fee , but no attendant is there to help you park the car .

Foreigners are however spared largely cos they are delivered directly to the gate , from the ticket counter , in electric carts . I guess this comes complementary with the high value ticket . There are agents inside who will nag you though . Also , buy shoe covers if you are going inside . Else you have to take your shoes off approximately 100 meters away from the mausoleum and walk on the cold ( or hot ) slabs .

We have no choice but to pay - we are suckers to the Indian scam !

Apparently , only guide books are allowed but not reading books for pleasure . What kind of country is India if they refuse to let foreigners bring in a reading book ? Then , when I was asked to give the books to my guide , and I informed the officer that I did not have a guide , they looked at me blankly as if they assumed that every White foreigner should have a guide .

When she came to security check , the security officer lady opened my niece's little bag , found the little animal toys and said that these are suspicious items and need to confiscate . The officer was not just joking to the kid . She was about to take the toys away from the little girl . My sister told the officer how this little doll is precious for her little girl . Then they finally got the toys back to my niece . When my Mum talked about this to several people including relatives and friends and myself , all said that the small toys could not be suspicious item with bullet or any hazardous things hidden in . But most likely the security officer wanted to put the little bear into her pocket and give to her own child or to entertain herself , or sell to robber's market to earn cash . So ridiculous . Positive thing was my sister's ability to protect her daughter's belongings from such criminal action by rotten security officer . She could get these toys back from the officer .

No sooner than I started eating than people were knocking on the window wanting to offer me special discounts . My driver even let a guy in the vehicle and he told me he was going to be my guide . I came there for peace and quiet and never achieved it while there . When I went to go into restroom there were 5 guys standing in there and one of them demanded to me that I would pay 5 rupees to use the toilet . I told him he had not right to talk to me that way and I was going to use the restroom . The guys got up acting like they were going to rob me but me being an American and ex military I stared them down . I went to the security guys at the one gate to notify them but they did not act in the least bit interested . I went through my tour as a high value customer with no issues except the tour guides assigned to me wanted to get paid tips for walking with me . I had already done a goggle on the Taj and was aware of all the facts and figures . I am not happy that they charge so much and yet no security exists to protect tourist from the harassing conditions one feels when trying to get there . I walked in 49 centigrade heat rather than have another person bother me but they still harassed me . If asked would I do this again the answer would be HELL NO ! Not worth the aggravation .

BUT , we were immediately surrounded by beggars and children aggressively selling trinkets , which was unpleasant but perhaps to be expected . then when viewing the taj mahal , the sheer mass of people meant that we were quickly marshalled round the tomb by aggressive staff in military uniforms and piercing whistles and out again within perhaps 2-3 minutes . I think we might have gone on a particularly busy day . There were only 3 female toilets which left a lot to be desired . If you must go , hire a driver and a guide who will get you to the head of the queues , and be able to answer questions , give you some history and so on . take your own food and drink and - important ! - toilet roll and hand sanitizer . do not buy photo's or trinkets on the way in . you can judge for yourselves and buy on the way out of you choose .",,,,2,"Fort William, United Kingdom",United Kingdom,Fiery0pal

There is actual human waste in the streets . And that is the good parts . Inside of the compound ( after an hour line and some comically stupid security later ) it is just ok . A billion tourists with selfie sticks . The inside of the Taj itself is pretty and cool given the age . However , it is under whelming to be honest . I have been to other wonders of the world and this is dead last . You get hustled in and out of the inside by the crush of humans moving through . After being so annoyed and under whelmed we did not end up exploring much . We just left . Agra Fort is a better experience . Less crowds , great views , and fewer drug addicts , pick pockets , and beggers . Honestly I would not wish the Taj Mahal or Agra on my worst enemy . it is a horribly overrated palace experience .

Part of this is due to the overly slick guide we ended up with , and his photographer cohort . They were extremely rude to Indian families , trying to shoo them off benches so we could have photos taken , which we refused to do . We were mortified . We did not mind paying the higher price for tickets , as it is totally fair for Indians to pay less . We did mind being shoehorned into the entry chamber of the Taj . There were guards there , but they had no control whatsoever of the crowds , just jamming them in until you would not have fallen down if you fainted , no joke . One person fell going in because of pushing and shoving . We left the tour at this point . We went on a weekend - try to avoid that because the crowds are bigger then .

Secondly , they took all of my food away which is fair since they tell you in advance that this is not allowed .

When I asked why she could enter and that this was not fair , the woman police officer just looked at me and rolled her eyes . Third , When we tried to complain at the main office inside the Taj , we dealt with men who spoke English until they realized we were complaining and then suddenly could not speak English . We were given a BIG complaint book to write in and then shrugged off as well . And finally , While in the Taj I had to get the police because of a group of men who would not stop taking my picture and rubbing their private parts while doing it .

I was all geared up to visit the Taj after a weeklong planning and route mapping . I was prepared to drive all the way from Delhi to Agra on the bumpy road only to get a glimpse of the mesmerizing Taj Mahal . Unfortunately after all the hardship was not worth the efforts . Parking is 2kms away from the entry gate . I was advised to take the east gate for a quick access by one of the guides at the Agra fort . After crossing a maze I have managed to get myself to the east gate . Struggled for about 30minutes to manage a parking bay . Then when I started to walk towards the monument plenty of tongawalas or the Auto rickshaw drivers pounced on me to drive me to the gate . Believe me that is at 10times the price for the distance . Again to my surprise the vehicle was only to cover half the distance only . I continued walking towards the monument for another kilometer and found myself in the queue as long as Great Wall of China . Sad sad sad , to top it up was the rude behavior of the security force at the monument . They do not care if its women , children or elderly people , they have only learnt the language of PUSH . After a 45minute long wait I managed to pass through the security check . Then came the next hurdle to make my way to the monument . People were crazy taking pictures of the monument . The only saving grace was the magnificent white marble monument shining in the bright sun . But it looked no different in the pictures and videos available in the books and online . Now comes the turn of the photographers to suck your book to click a picture , they do not spare you unless they do not take your picture . I was made to take my shoes off and made to walk bare foot on the hot marble as hot as frying pan . I had tears in my eyes and cursed myself to have taken this decision to visit Taj . The queue was too long and I was made to go round the monument thrice before I could enter the tomb . Here comes the worse of all , the security gaurd at the entrance of the tomb started to push hundreds of people physically into the center hall and then pushed out without even getting an opportunity to take a glimpse of the toms of Shah Jahan and Mumtaz Mahal . that is it this washed all my love for this monument and I left the city of Agra with great disappointment and just getting out of the traumatic experience .

Taj_NEG_72,22-Jan-17,Jan-17,14,January,January,"do not do it . do not do it . do not do it . Unless you have already seen it during the day . But do not waste your time at night . do not get me wrong . The Taj Mahal is the most magnificent building I have ever seen , and well worth a daytime visit . But the full moon thing ? do not do it . Why ? Because they put you through an hour plus of security , frisking , police with machine guns etc only to arrive at the Taj and not be able to get past the gate ! At night , they put up a metal barricade , so you cannot get anywhere near the Taj Mahal . The fountains are shut off , the place is dark and you can only vaguely make out the silhouette of the building through the haze of serious air pollution . do not visit the Taj Mahal under the full moon in the way its currently set up .",,,,37,"Chicago, Illinois",United States of America,jjh2042
Taj_NEG_73,16-Jan-17,Jan-17,20,January,January,"Born in india , i heard about Taj , but could not visit . Moved to USA so many years ago and had chance to see Taj couple weeks ago . What a Scam . Yes , 40 Rupee fee for Local and 500 fee for Forefinger ? 2nd . Guide-None of the guide has proper knowledge , they all have is made up stories . They have no clue of construction . 1st of All there is no Mosque in the world is built near river . 2nd is There is no mosque which has Tombs near them . 3rd is Lotus is not part of any Muslim architecture . Now with all the viewing close for 1st Floor , what you able to see is FAKE tombs on 2nd Floor . you cannot stand for 5 minutes and absorb the beauty of stone work . Constant pushing by people and police , out out out . Smell , lines and selling agents are every where . you cannot walk , traffic just want to run over . Most of surrounding building are closed ! India , what you have done to our Monument zeeeeeeeeeeee its shame . Well for tourist , there are amazing architecture next door , its called akshardham Mandir I am not fan of temple but construction is amazing . At least its free ! and no seller outside ( well inside they are selling their products as usual ) So do not forget to see other architecture too .",,,,17,"New York City, New York",United States of America,majanu
Taj_NEG_215,16-Jan-13,Dec-12,11,January,December,"Everybody talks about how marvelous is the Taj Mahal , for that reason I decided to visited it when I passed by Agra . My guide and the locals suggested to visit it in the early morning to see the sunrise reflected on the building , so for that reason the next morning I leave my hotel at 6:30 am but the problem was the fog ! Was like to be in an horror movie coz I was not able to see where I was walking by . With luck I arrived to the queue and payed a 20 euro 's fee to get in to the building , the place was officially opened by 7:30 and was very cold , when finally I get in was impossible to see the Taj at all , it was completely covered by the fog ! I wait until 10 am and finally I could see something but not to have a proper view and that was very disappointing . So before you go plz verify which one is the best season to visit the place . Another important thing to mention is on the net there is a company who develops a sw you can download on your phone and offer you a guided tour so you do not need anymore a guide to make your visit . This company is the same one who develop the audio tour's for different city sights and I must say is very , very good . The product is called Audio Compass . If the day is clear ask your guide carry you by the side of the Jamuna River where you can see the Taj , is a very nice view too . Good luck !",,,,63,"Dublin, Ireland",Ireland,SasuD

It took ages to go through security , all our bags were taken off us , even the pens in our pocket . All that can be taken through is money , still camera and passport . you will need to put the rest in a locker for collection on your return . As for the Taj Mahal itself , its not flood lit so even in a full moon you can hardly see it . You can only enter just through the gateway on a platform so you are a long way away from the actual monument . Make sure you plan your moon light visit , otherwise , like us , the moon will be the opposite side of the sky to the Taj so will not even get into the picture ( that is if you have learned how to operate your camera's manual settings otherwise you will just get a blank screen ) .",,,,43,"Peterborough, United Kingdom",United Kingdom,Sian372

Taj_NEG_77,19-Nov-16,Nov-16,14,November,November,"Yes the Taj is lovely but the experience was horrible . After paying a gazillion times more as a foreigner to support the upkeep of the Taj , I stand in line for almost two hours with everyone else , including obviously well off Indian tourists . The men's line was moving 3 times faster as they had more metal detectors and screeners . I am a patient person but the conditions were deplorable . It was so bad there was an actual riot by the end of the line . All the women were yelling and shoving past security . The security was overwhelmed with the reactions as everyone just started busting through . Keep hundreds of woman in cattle like conditions in the heat for a few hours , what did they expect ? We just could not breath anymore ! After finally making it through I had a few breaths of space and air , only to be set upon by a constant barrage of harassment from touts that surrounded me and blocked my way . Bottom line - India if you expect tourists to pay a ridiculous amount more to support the upkeep of your sites , start treating them with some respect , call off the harassers and treat women equally ! Perhaps instead of selling Indian vs Foreigner tickets , you could sell general admission vs VIP tickets as they do in most countries . That way you give all nationalities ( including tourists who are Indian nationals ) the opportunity to choose / pay for special treatment ( such as shorter lines ) or join the general stream . Bottom line - I would have paid double the admission to have avoided this terrible experience altogether .","experience;$;""men's line"";conditions;$;$;security;conditions;$;touts;amount,sites;$;$;experience","-1;$;1;-1;$;$;-1;-1;$;-1;-1,-1;$;$;-1","horrible;$;""moving 3 times faster"";deplorable;$;$;""overwhelmed with reactions"";""cattle-like"";$;""constant barrage of harassment"";ridiculous,upkeep;$;$;terrible",45,"Toronto, Canada",Canada,LJean72

This was just another been there , done that - experience I could have been without . Since we went several hours by car to do Taj , we wanted to do the most out of it and hired a guide .

Taj_NEG_79,28-Oct-16,Oct-16,4,October,October,"Taj Mahal , the name itself so heavy , I was expecting it to be the cleanest and most well-maintained monuments of all that I had seen , but to my dismay - The Taj Mahal has one of the most dirtiest and unclean entrances ever . There are many entry points but no boards which lead you to the right place . If UP Tourism is using Taj's name , why not make it better , My experience was pathetic .

Taj_NEG_80,22-Oct-16,Oct-16,21,October,October,"One of the worst experiences we have had in India thus far . We booked Agra bus tickets through a travel agent . The ticket price was 600 RS per person , 1200 in total for up and down . The ticket said it would pick us up from the place near to our New Delhi hotel at 6:15 am . But the bus came around 8ish . Though our tickets was for New Delhi - Agra - New Delhi , the travel agent did not tell us that it would take us to Mathura and Brindabon ( Two pilgrimage sites of Hindus ) . We were so shocked to find out about this ! We could not even see the Taj and Agra fort properly as the bus people only gave an hour to visit ( as they had to run off to those holy places ) . Being a foreigner who has no interest in Hinduism , I along with my family had to visit scary alleys of Mathura and Brindabon at 1AM in the night . What was supposed to be a simple bus ride to see Tajmahal , ended up being a 24 hours of nightmare . I was not the only sufferer , I saw many other foreign tourists who were going through the same nightmare . Tourists need to be aware of such touts while travelling that is why I thought it was necessary to review Taj . So pointers if you want to visit Taj - 1 ) do not go by bus or a travel agent . Bus company have contract with shops for food and souvenirs . They will spend hours in these shops rather than showing you the actual Taj . Best solution - Hire a taxi . it would be expensive , around 6 to 7 thousand rupees but will be worth every penny . 2 ) do not visit on Sunday . it is crowded . 3 ) Security is excessively tight . you are going to have to pay for your handy camera .",,,,2,none,none,Trina M

It takes 24 hours to book the visit with some ministry you have to take a cab to , you pay ( or you pay some tour guide to do it for you in advance ( they need passport copies you wait , you arrive for the visit and they strip you of everything except your camera , no kidding , not even water bottles are allowed , then they bus you to the entrance , you walk to the outer building and that is where you stand blocked by gates and guards to view way off in the sea of darkness , nothing , nothing .

Taj_NEG_230,31-Aug-08,,19,August,,"I will not say that the Taj Mahal is not beautiful , it is certainly something to see in India . When you think of India , you think the Taj Mahal . However , it was not the most beautiful thing I found in India . There is so much hype going in to see the Taj Mahal , and what you find is a little dim in comparison to what you had expected . I had seen the Taj after traveling over much of India and besides the Taj I think there are ancient temples and forts that are far more extraordinary than the Taj Mahal . In my opinion the Golden Temple in Amritsar or the Amber Fort in Jaipur . Getting to the Taj Mahal is also frightening . Even compared to much of India , Agra is one of the most dirty and frightening places to travel to . The Taj Mahal is literally a gem sticking out of the middle of a coal mine . Inside the Taj it is beautifully kept , the water and the gardens are well maintained . It is very crowded inside , however . it is nearly impossible to get a picture with just you in it . Going anywhere outside of your hotel and the Taj Mahal is frightening . My friends and I went to find somewhere decent to eat in the vicinity of the Taj , and the best we found a a place on top of a roof and were served flourescent pasta along with some cockroaches . Bugs in the drinks even , not in the food . I am not sure how they managed that . I am not saying the Taj Mahal is not worth seeing , because I think it is one of those things where if you go to India it is a must-see . But , I would not suggest staying overnight there . There is not too much else to see that you cannot find in other states .",,,,11,"Ithaca, New York",USA,kelseyoh
Taj_NEG_231,31-Jul-08,,10,July,,"When I first saw the Taj Mahal 10 years ago , my breath was taken away . It was so beautiful , magnificent - and really captured India's history . Now , however , I feel as though India is somewhat ashamed of that history . As I understand it , an oil refinery has been set up not too many miles away . The atmosphere must therefore contain chemicals which can damage the beauty of the Taj Mahal . A structure that has lasted for centuries because of its amazing crafting is now slowly turning brown . I know what I saw , it did not have the same unique colour to it when I visited last month - there were bits of brown all over , and it did not have that spectacular glow . Emperor Shah Jahan made the Taj Mahal especially to enclose his wife's tomb , which is special within itself . But it is now losing its characteristic qualities , and within 100 years may be forgotten whilst India tries to promote other jewels within its land . I find it heartbreaking .",,,,3,London,United Kingdom,Lilly6London

Taj_NEG_233,10-Nov-06,,14,November,,"My mother had not seen the Taj Mahal for fifty years and she asked us to tke her there . The politicians in Agra are reputed to be amongst the most corrupt in India and despite receiving a great deal of money in tourism revenues , no money has been spent in improving the infrastructure of that city . We hired a car for half a day but were given a run around by the driver and the guide who took us around to all kinds of expensive stores / restaurants rather than the sights we wanted to see . Getting into the Taj is a problem as there were queues at the main gate stretching back for two hours . There is another gate and one of the local guides presuaded us to part with a day's salary and take us to this entrance . No mobile phones are allowed inside and have to be left in the office . We were searched as is normal but the female guard took a fancy to a little plastic monkey charm that was attached to my Kipling rucksack . I knew I would never see it again and I put it in the office . The office closed at 5:00 pm and that meant I would not see the Taj at sunset , as we had planned to do . The monument is very busy inside and you need to watch your purse carefully . The grounds have been landscaped since my visit ten years ago and are quite pleasant to sit in and take a break from the heat , dust and the beggars and touts outside . Our taxi had left by now and we went back to the welcome comfort of our hotel , Clarks Shiraz . Would I come back to Agra ? No way !",,,,45,London,United Kingdom,2804

Taj_NEG_85,28-Sep-16,Sep-16,2,September,September,"The surroundings of this wonder of the world is really bad , you have to dribble yourself through troublesome guides , horsecart people , auto rickshaws and so much dust and dirt , that when you reach inside to view the actual Taj mahal , the awe is just not enough . Had a very bad experience .",,,,8,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",India,ishmeet82
Taj_NEG_86,13-Sep-16,Feb-16,10,September,February,"Obviously a fantastic building . No question about that at all . However , what a let down ! We were encouraged to see it early in the morning light but I suspect this was to ensure more visitors got in . Certainly there was no advantage as far as the quality of light was concerned . The problem lies in the pollution which Agra suffers from . The result is that you view this iconic building through a haze of smog - scarcely the romantic image you have taken from so many earlier photographs . In addition , comments regarding the poverty apparent to the rear of the Taj Mahal proved less accurate - my angst was more to do with the rubbish and other detritus that had been allowed to accumulate . All this might have been excusable when India was impoverished , but as a proud , independent , democratic - and relatively well off country - it should get its act together and sort these problems out ! Not , incidentally , by simply forcing local residents to move .",,,,185,"London, United Kingdom",United Kingdom,Andrew S
Taj_NEG_87,11-Sep-16,Sep-16,6,September,September,"What you do not know on arrival in carpark , as part of the Rps1000 ticket you get a trip to and from the carpark in a motorised taxi . We hot harrased but supposefly official guides , then various horse and bicycle taxi drivers . Finally getting to the entrans we get an real guide for the Taj . The harrsment did not stop , we finally got upset and walked back to the carpark in heat and 100 % humidity . Been there , done that , never again . Our worst experience in India .",,,,27,"Cape Town Central, South Africa",Paraguay,Ushandra
Taj_NEG_88,5-Sep-16,Jul-16,7,September,July,"We are a family of five , with only one child under 15 and so it would have cost us 4000 rupees ( 60 euro ) to visit the Taj Mahal , compared to 40 rps for an Indian . As a result , there was a snaking queue of national tourists , and not a soul at the foreigners ticket office . We came across this tourist rate issue so many times in India , that time and again we found ourselves deciding it was just too much to pay . At other sites , the student rate for foreign tourists was denied to our children ( all under 18 ) because we did not have an official card to prove that they were still at school ( obligatory at their ages in our country ) . Highly frustrating . One reason we went to India was to enjoy a relatively cheap trip . We are not a rich family , even compared to some Indians , and found this foreign ticket policy left us with a frustrated , bitter taste that tainted our view of India .",,,,9,"Cannes, France",France,FrenchFannyMarie
Taj_NEG_89,25-Aug-16,Jul-16,8,August,July,"I have expected so much more from all the history I read and pictures I had seen . What was the disappointment when you arrive and you see that it is actually less appealing than expected . Also it is rather hard to get to it as the cars are not allowed next to it , and need to leave a car far away and wait for the free shuttle which is not always available and crowded . The security at the entrance is very strict and does not allow bags , cigarettes , matches , or anything else , but camera or phone only . Do not forget to pick up complimentary water and covers for the shoes which are mandatory when you get on the marble . Inside is terribly hot , humid , dark and noisy . There are signs to keep it low , but the staff who works there blow the whistles hard to push the people move . Overall , can be visited to tick the box in your bucket list , but get prepared for some disappointment too .",,,,114,"New York City, New York",United States of America,globajetset

It was about 120 degrees out so there were not too many people there . Was saddened by the abject poverty surrounding the Taj . Even the horses used to transport visitors looked like they were going to drop dead at any second . Overall , for the amount of money that comes in through ticket sales , it is very discouraging to see the lack of infrastructure in Agra and around the Taj . It exists in so many other areas that do not have 1 / 10th of the visitors , so where does the income go ? But what was most upsetting is that visitors refuse to follow any rules ! You are not allowed to take photos but everyone was taking selfies , in a mausoleum ! You are not allowed to linger and families were eating on the floor . You have to wear shoe covers and the guards do not bother to ask you to throw them in the bins , there are thousands of them littering the entire grounds . Very sad .",,,,75,none,none,TheFordFamily

Taj_NEG_102,5-Jun-16,Jun-16,31,June,June,"Disappointing is the adjective that sums up the Taj Mahal experience . The architecture is great , the story interesting but that is where the romantic notion stops . The whole experience is marred by the people who just do not care about anything but money , from the government to the grounds staff , no one has any sense of pride in their work , the Taj Mahal or the guests who are lining their corrupt pockets . 1000 rupees per person to go in to visit the Taj Mahal , we visited at 0600 to see the sunrise via the East Gate . Our pre arranged taxi did not turn up , so we asked Security at our hotel ( Marriott Courtyard ) to call us a tuk tuk . Immediately we had a lift and for 300 rupees return , we were sorted cheaper than the taxi who wanted to charge double for the 3km return journey ) . After buying our ticket from the booking office ( approx 700m from the entrance collecting our included bottle of water and shoe covers ( which must be worn in the mausoleum ) and took a rickshaw to the entrance for 100 rupees each way . We did not try bartering with either of our two drivers as it was still cheaper than the taxi driver . Unfortunately , opportunists are everywhere trying to get you to buy their services for a photo , their rickshaw ( even though you have one a tour , a souvenir , clothes etc . Having to repeatedly say no thank you is exhausting and frustrating , especially when you are not being listened to but just harassed . Upon entry , you go through security , metal detectors and X-Ray for bags . Men on right , women on left side . More photographers and guides ( official / unofficial you cannot tell and apparently a lot of ID is fake not that I would know what I am looking at in the first place ) ! trying to get you to buy their services . The view is lovely with the garden and water fountains before you leading to the mausoleum . When you near the steps to the mausoleum , you have to put your shoe covers on ( or remove your shoes altogether ) . it is not the sun coming over the horizon that you see but the sun climbing up into the sky . As one should have realised , this gives a very slight yellow ( golden is a bit poetic license ) tinge to the marble , although the semi precious stones that are the flower art work do glint in the light . Inside the mausoleum it is dark and difficult to see the artwork clearly Pay close attention to the rules . Only take a camera , phone and water with you . More than likely you will be made to dispose of anything else ( or go back to the booking office to store in a locker that is limited and on a first come , first served basis ) . The lack of care is sad to see . There are shoe covers and water bottles disregarded all over the gardens ( the majority of national people seem to think littering is acceptable why these cannot be disposed of carefully or picked up by the grounds staff ( instead of them trying to point you to the best vantage point then asking for tips ) is just thoughtless and lazy . On the return , ( as previously mentioned ) you are harassed , however , the rickshaw and tuk tuk drivers we had were polite , courteous and reliable . The hype of the Taj Mahal exceeds the reality . We have visited Humayun's Tomb in Delhi and the mausoleums within Lodi Gardens that are also in Delhi that are equally beautiful if not quite as well renovated . Yesterday we took said taxi that let us down this morning to the other side of the Yamuna river for a view at sunset for 600 rupees return . 200 rupees each to get into Mehtab Burj ( ruins of a supposed planned black Taj Mahal for emperor Shah Jahan ) so that we could see the Taj Mahal as the sun set . It was ok but did not WOW us . My advice is to read up on the history before you go rather than hire a guide and save yourself 1000 rupees . Good luck !",,,,11,"Lindfield, United Kingdom",United Kingdom,LorraineS211
Taj_NEG_103,1-Jun-16,Dec-15,12,June,December,"The politicians in Agra are reputed to be among the most corrupt in India and despite receiving a great deal of money in tourism revenues , no money has been spent in improving the infrastructure of that city . Getting into the Taj is a problem as there were queues at the main gate stretching back for two hours . There is another gate and one of the local guides presuaded us to part with a day's salary and take us to this entrance . No mobile phones are allowed inside and have to be left in the office . The monument is very busy inside and you need to watch your purse carefully . The grounds have been landscaped and are quite pleasant to sit in and take a break from the heat , dust and the beggars and touts outside . The Taj Mahal is really suffering from age , neglect and pollution . The standard photos in books and post cards are very old and deceiving . I do not think it was worth it and I would recommend staying elsewhere and going over to see the Taj as an afternoon excursion .

We explained that we were foreigners and we were in the correct line , after which we were mocked and met with laughter for the fact that we were Indian's speaking English . All backpacks have to go through a security check before entering the Taj . The security felt the need to allow every other foreign tourist through without checking their bags but just had to stop our family and critically check each of us . In my backpack , I had a sample of my wedding invitation . They found this and started shouting at me and demanded that I throw it in the trash . We could not understand why , they were literally just giving us a hard time for no reason . Our tour guide had to intervene to stop the security from their absolutely psychotic behaviour .

Our plan had been to arrive at dawn , and I am sure we would have had a more positive experience if that was the case , but a late train meant we arrived in mid-morning . After deciding to go to the South Gate to make sure we could get through in time and beat the queues at West Gate , we discovered that , despite MASSIVE SIGNS and every form of guide and reference advertising it , there was NO CLOAK ROOM AT THE SOUTH GATE . So we had to get ripped off by local shop keepers to hold our bags for us , or waste our time walking over to the West Gate and standing in line for twice as long . Once we got the ticket , we once again encountered bureaucratic nonsense , a paper coffee cup and a cardboard sign we had written , to take sentimental photos as we were missing my mother in law's birthday back home , were confiscated at the gate . Why ? They did not read the sign and decide it was a bad message ( happy birthday ) ? We had about 45 minutes to get into the place by this point so there was no time to argue . In the bin . I am sure the soldiers at the gate were shaking us down for a bribe , we would not give them the satisfaction . Honestly , we expect touts and those who profit from tourism , but not this kind of treatment from the police or armed forces . What scum . Paper and cardboard are no risk to safety , we would have happily held onto them and brought them back out with us so we were not putting undue strain on the bins inside , bureaucratic nonsense . The numbers of tourists were immense by the time we got inside . Fair enough , it is a world wonder . But for all this money coming in , why is it being so poorly managed ? A bloody cloak room is not a hard thing to administer , it would have made everything about our visit easier and more enjoyable . it is a shame that the administrators of this amazing site think of foreign tourists as cash cows with no need for pleasant treatment .",,,,77,"Wollongong, Australia",Australia,445patrickh

The Taj is something that was on each of our bucket lists , and I can say that it fell completely short of any expectations . Here's why - Getting There It is a brutal drive from Delhi because of city traffic . There is little to do in Agra , which is a very poor , dirty city located near the Taj When you arrive on grounds , tuk tuk and camel drivers will swarm you to have them take you from the parking lot to the entrance gate 200 meters ) . - You will also be solicited by street vendors and children trying to steal your bags or beg for money . MIND YOUR BELONGINGS . At the Taj You will take some beautiful photographs Photographs you could have seen in a magazine rather than endure + 100 degree temperatures and hoards of people for There are no restrooms All you can do is walk the grounds , walk inside the mausoleum , and walk into the mosques on either side of the main building . Let me emphasize - ALL you can do is WALK AROUND The buildings are beautiful , and the stories and legends behind it make it enchanting , but the actual visit itself is lackluster As a foreigner , we as both in a group and individually were approached by dozens of Indian families and for pictures . In the two hours we spent there , we hard our pictures taken by + 20 Indians / families . Other Details As a small aside , unlike other historic monuments , the Taj does not have anything to describe what you are seeing ( i.e. tours , brochures , plaques ) . There are literally only the grounds , and nothing else , so read up before you visit Bring water with you . There is nothing sold on the grounds , so you will regret not having something to drink with you before venturing out .",,,,24,"Charlotte, North Carolina",United States of America,WorktoWeekend

Do not get a guide ( most are fake guides they will show you a fake ID pretending they are official guides where there are only few handy official guides ) and do not buy any souvenir ( everything is a rip off , they will tell you gov prices etc , what is a basic miss information ) any quoted tuktuk price give them only 30 % of what they ask for ask they take a laugh out of tourists .",,,,93,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,Gandalfquest

Ok , so the ticket price is a million times more for foreigners than it is for Indians , after cycling around India for three months I have just about become used to this racist , exploitative practice ( despite there being many millions of Indians who are more wealthy than me ) . 750 rupees compared to 20 . A large part of this is for the Agra Development Tax , presumably this is syphoned off as Agra is a smelly dump , the approach to the Taj is a complete mess and it acts as a gauntlet for scam artists and hustlers . You have to buy your ticket 1km away and start your journey to the architectural wonder by fending off pestering people who constantly hassle you . Sure this is common in India , but after paying my extortionate entrance fee it would be nice for this to be cleaned up . At the ticket office there is a sign showing what is forbidden inside - I checked and made sure nothing I had in my bad was not allowed . Walk 1km , join the queue and get searched - everyone in this process was EXCEPTIONALLY rude . About ten items from by bag were deemed not allowed , small spare things for my camera and a 's elfie stick ( none of this was mentioned on the poster ) . I was told to get out with my options being bin the items , find someone to look after them for me or walk back to the ticket office and use a locker . So walk 1km back dealing with the hassle , then walk back 1km to get to the Taj , because our tickets had been checked already before security we were then told our tickets had been used and we could not go in again ! I had to argue for 10 minutes that we had not even been in yet ! Security check again , I saw many Indian tourists being allowed in with the items that we were prohibited entering with . Inside everyone is harassing you for money - want to go to the toilet ? Despite the big sign that says free for foreigners the staff ask for tips the guards ask for tips the ticket people ask for tips and then going back the locker people ask for tips do not GIVE ANYONE ANYTHING ! After being charged the crazy price of 750 rupees I was not going to give a penny to anyone . If you want to charge tourists so much more then the visitor experience needs to be changed . It sucks , guides harass you , workers harass you , staff are rude and you are sent running about trying to store things that no one tells you you can not take in . It is dirty , it stinks and the ticket is only for one entry . Something needs to change if you want to charge foreigners so much more - perhaps allowing us to enter multiple times ? It would be nice to be able to visit in the afternoon and the morning , or go out to have food and go back in again .

After we got the ticket at an exorbiant rate of 750 rs per person we had to go through security screening again .

From the entrance at the roundabout when you get of your coach or taxi you will be greeted by the stench of very stale urine from the very unkept camels and horses not to mention the piles of crap all over the place , once you recover from the smell all the touts and guides will hastle you to death . Just ignore them and walk the 200m down a road which is like waking through a building site , its a disgrace . Why cannot the use some of the 1,000 , 000 a week to give visitors a nice experience from start to finish . I wonder where the money goes ? You do not need a guide but beware , to enter The Taj you will go through a metal detector and any bags you are carrying will be x-rayed this is where the fun begins . When your bag is x-rayed the Army checkers will rumage through your bag and pick thing out that they will say are not allowed , i had a portable radio , a torch , my mobile phone charger , a mini tripod for my camera removed from my bag NOT ALLOWED you have a choice now they throw it in the bin at the checking station or you take them back so you can walk back 500m to a locker room where you can pay r30 for then to go in an open shelve till you get back .

This is pure discrimination and that too against people who bring in maximum revenues for the tourism industry in India ! The area around the Taj is quite good and well maintained , but when i got to the actual structure itself , it appeared to be yellowing with age and the ASI were doing some work on restoring the fascade in places where the building appeared to be crumbling . I entered the Taj and was pushed by the security to make a move on , i walked around the monument in a circle , and that was it ! Nothing more to see ! It was a total dampner , apparently people are not allowed on the lower floor of the Taj due to vandalism and the like . It was very disappointing that all i got to see was a few precious stones which were embedded in the marble . The searing heat was kept out and i felt quite cool inside the taj , but nothing else to write home about . The shopping centers around the taj are total rip-offs and should be avoided . Also , the local rickshaw guys try to pull a fast one on you if you look remotely foreign ( or dressed in shorts for that matter ) . All in all , it was a very disappointing visit for me .

Unfortunately it was a let down . It was noisy and crowded ( obviously because people flock to be there - Indians and foreigner alike ) . It looked more of a park where people came for picnics . A lot of couples spend their time with each other within the premises hoping to be struck by the arrow of love . There are much better places in Agra that would be rated far above the Taj Mahal . Also , one can not take pictures inside the Taj . Neither can you spend more than 5 secs inside because there is a huge line and the volunteers / guards keeping urging you to move along . On top of that , the tombs of Shah Jahan and Mumtaz Mahal is covered with a outer wall which has a lot of pores . As in , it is not a Hard opaque wall but one can hardly see anything . So i did not see any point in entering the Taj Mahal at all if I could not see the tombs properly . However , on second thoughts , i did visit the taj mahal in the afternoon . Had i visited the place early morning , i am sure i would have given a much better review . Hopefully I would get a chance to visit Taj again in the morning and I shall be back to update my review .

Taj_NEG_209,2-Apr-13,Mar-13,28,April,March,"Like many I have been made believe that the Taj Mahal is the best monument in India . But to my surprise it has been a big disappointment . I was all geared up to visit the Taj after a weeklong planning and route mapping . I was prepared to drive all the way from Delhi to Agra on the bumpy road only to get a glimpse of the mesmerizing Taj Mahal . Unfortunately after all the hardship was not worth the efforts . Parking is 2kms away from the entry gate . I was advised to take the east gate for a quick access by one of the guides at the Agra fort . After crossing a maze I have managed to get myself to the east gate . Struggled for about 30minutes to manage a parking bay . Then when I started to walk towards the monument plenty of tongawalas or the Auto rickshaw drivers pounced on me to drive me to the gate . Believe me that is at 10times the price for the distance . Again to my surprise the vehicle was only to cover half the distance only . I continued walking towards the monument for another kilometer and found myself in the queue as long as Great Wall of China . Sad sad sad , to top it up was the rude behavior of the security force at the monument . They do not care if its women , children or elderly people , they have only learnt the language of PUSH . After a 45minute long wait I managed to pass through the security check . Then came the next hurdle to make my way to the monument . People were crazy taking pictures of the monument . The only saving grace was the magnificent white marble monument shining in the bright sun . But it looked no different in the pictures and videos available in the books and online . Now comes the turn of the photographers to suck your book to click a picture , they do not spare you unless they do not take your picture . I was made to take my shoes off and made to walk bare foot on the hot marble as hot as frying pan . I had tears in my eyes and cursed myself to have taken this decision to visit Taj . The queue was too long and I was made to go round the monument thrice before I could enter the tomb . Here comes the worse of all , the security gaurd at the entrance of the tomb started to push hundreds of people physically into the center hall and then pushed out without even getting an opportunity to take a glimpse of the toms of Shah Jahan and Mumtaz Mahal . that is it this washed all my love for this monument and I left the city of Agra with great disappointment and just getting out of the traumatic experience . My advice to fellow visitor would be to visit Taj Mahal during week day and off vacation timings . You may still get an opportunity to take a careful look at India's Pride .",,,,15,Delhi,India,BUSSARY

Was like to be in an horror movie coz I was not able to see where I was walking by . With luck I arrived to the queue and payed a 20 euro 's fee to get in to the building , the place was officially opened by 7:30 and was very cold , when finally I get in was impossible to see the Taj at all , it was completely covered by the fog ! I wait until 10 am and finally I could see something but not to have a proper view and that was very disappointing . So before you go plz verify which one is the best season to visit the place .

This company is the same one who develop the audio tour's for different city sights and I must say is very , very good . The product is called Audio Compass .
